Abstract

These notes aim at fulfilling two different and somewhat contradictory objectives:

1) to give a general introduction to the parametrization of radiation transfer (RT) in numerical weather prediction and climate
models. This might be useful to people who wish to look at general circulation model (GCM) outputs and to understand
qualitatively how radiation transfer in clear and cloudy atmospheres is linked to the other physical processes, and how it can
influence the atmospheric motions. In that case, the internal behaviour of the radiation scheme might remain a black box.

2) to provide a reasonably complete description of the RT parametrizations presently used in the ECMWF model to help
understand the specific properties of the ECMWF forecasts. While the former task requires only basic knowledge of physics,
the latter requires much more insight in how a RT scheme works.

The following pages somehow attempt to tackle these two tasks. After an introduction, the second chapter discusses the
radiation budget at the top, and within the atmosphere, both globally and more regionally in relation with the other terms of the
atmospheric energy balance. The third chapter is devoted to the derivation of the RT equation from an observational and

qualitative point of view and to the introduction to the basic laws of physics necessary to understand the RT. The
simplifications that can be used when dealing with RT in the Earth’s atmosphere, and the various approximations needed to
make the RT a problem tractable for a numerical model of the atmosphere are also presented in chapter 3. The main aspects of
the various RT parametrizations presently used in the ECMWF forecasting system are presented in chapter 4, together with the
specification of the cloud optical properties. Examples of validation of various aspects of the parametrization of cloud-
radiation interactions with observed radiation fields are presented in chapter 5. As a matter of conclusion, some comments on
the future of RT calculations, and on some other radiation-related hot topics are given in chapter 6.

1. INTRODUCTION: AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Among the various processes responsible for the diabatic heating of the atmosphere (convection, turbulence, large-

scale condensation, heat, moisture and momentum transfer at the surface, radiation transfer), which have to be de-

scribed by physical parametrizations in a general circulation model (GCM), this last one stands because its impact

is felt at all times and over the whole 3-D domain. Compared to other processes, radiation transfer (RT) also stands

as having a long history of theoretical developments. From the statistical and quantum mechanics at the end of the

19th and beginning of the 20th century, Boltzmann, Stefan, Wien, Planck and Einstein made pioneering advances

in the spectral description of the radiation emitted by a black body. Afterwards, spectroscopic studies of the gases

important for the radiative budget of the atmosphere, and the development of various approximations made the cal-

culation of the radiation transfer in the atmosphere a tractable problem.

The very first such approximation is the separation between shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) schemes due to

the obvious wavelength difference between a black-body at Sun’s temperature (around 5800 K, with most of its

energy below 4 microns, and the energy source outside the atmosphere) and that of the atmosphere (globally aver-

aged equivalent temperature of about 255 K as seen from the top of the atmosphere, with most of its energy above

4 microns, and the sources being the surface, the radiatively active gases (mostly H2O, CO2, O3), and the clouds

within the atmosphere). Chandrasekhar (1935, 1958, 1960) provided the first approximations to the radiation

transfer in a scattering atmosphere. Elsasser (1938, 1942), Goody (1952, 1964), Curtis (1952, 1956), Godson

(1953), Malkmus (1967) defined the first usable simplifications to the spectral representation of the radiation trans-

fer including its dependence on two key atmospheric parameters, pressure and temperature, allowing atmospheric

heating/cooling rates to be computed (Rodgers and Walshaw, 1966).

To the point, that in the mid-70s, it was said (WMO/Global Atmospheric Research Program, 1975) that radiation

transfer was a solved problem, provided big enough computers were available. The only developments required

were for fast parametrizations. A good description of the various approximations used in the 80’s at the different

stages in the development of computer-efficient radiation schemes (and of the necessary trade-offs between accu-

racy and efficiency, two contradictory arguments) is given in Stephens (1984) and Fouquart (1987).

Unfortunately, the InterComparison of Radiation Codes for Climate Models (ICRCCM) at the end of the 80s (El-

lingson et al., 1991; Fouquart et al., 1991, Baer et al., 1996) showed that, if an overall good agreement in clear-

sky longwave computations by line-by-line models existed, large discrepancies were found in the results of both

the LW parametrized schemes and all types of SW schemes. Hereafter, at least for clear-sky atmospheres, these

were tracked down to deficiencies, mainly in the implementation of the approximations used to deal with the spec-

tral and vertical integrations.

Since ICRCCM, a number of parametrized RT schemes have been developed from line-by-line (LbLs) models so

that their accuracy, at least in clear-sky atmospheres, should be very close from that of LbLs (e.g., Ramaswamy and

Freidenreich, 1992; Edwards and Slingo, 1996; Mlawer et al., 1997, to name just a few. As far as clouds are con-

cerned, the situation is much more complex with an ongoing debate whether or not clouds might absorb more than

what current parametrizations account for, with the somewhat related role of the spatial inhomogeneities in the 3-

dimensional distribution of water condensates on the radiation fields within and at the boundaries of a cloud, with

the role that the overlapping of cloud layers plays on the vertical distribution of the radiative fluxes and heating

rates. Also the computational environment of a general circulation model might also impose some external limita-

tions on the quality of the representation of the cloud-radiation interactions. In the following sections, an overview

of these different questions will be provided.

2. THE EARTH’S RADIATIVE BALANCE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS

2.1  The need for parametrization

The need for a parametrization of the radiation transfer in a large-scale numerical model of the atmosphere stems

for two reasons:

• first, like the other physical processes (condensation, surface processes, turbulence, ...) the radiation

transfer actually occurs at spatial scales much smaller than the scales (e.g., interaction with cloud

droplets) explicitly resolved by the model in its treatment of the adiabatic part of the prognostic

equations;

• second, although the theory of radiation transfer has been well known for decades, the complexity

of the governing equation is such that it cannot be used starightforwardly in a large-scale model. A

much more computationally efficient scheme has to be designed to account for the effect of the

radiative processes.

2.2  Global mean considerations

The importance of the radiation transfer processes for the Earth’s atmosphere system is obvious: Radiation is the

only way through which the Earth-atmosphere system can exchange energy with the rest of the universe. The im-

portance of a proper representation of the radiative processes in climate modelling or weather forecasting (after a

few days) comes from this simple consideration;

A zero-dimensional energy balance model describes the global annual mean equilibrium of the Earth-atmosphere

system as

where is the planetary albedo (the ratio between reflected and incident solar energy at the top of the

atmosphere, ToA), is the “solar constant” (the flux of energy from the Sun at the mean Sun–Earth distance),

is the outgoing terrestrial longwave radiation, is the radiometric temperature of the Earth, and σ is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant ( W m-2 K-4 ). The factor 0.25 (= 1/4) arises from the Earth

intercepting solar radiation proportionally to its cross-section and emitting terrrestrial radiation proportionally to

its surface. According to the latest available satellite measurements (ERBE, Earth Radiation Budget Experiment,

Barkstrom and Smith, 1986) W m-2 and . Thus is 237 W m-2 and

K. The discrepancy between this value and the mean climatological surface temperature ( K) is

explained by the so-called “greenhouse” effect, which will be discussed later.

Fig. 1 presents the various radiative streams within the atmosphere after Ramanathan (1987). Out of the 343 W m-

2 of solar energy available at ToA in the 0.2 to 4 wavelength range, about 30% is reflected back to the outer

space without change of wavelength after scattering in the atmosphere and/or reflection at the Earth’s surface.

There the true solar imput to the atmosphere is about 237 W m-2. A large fraction of this reaches the surface and

is absorbed by land masses and oceans; only roughly one quarter of this solar radiation is absorbed within the at-

mosphere and creates a mean heating of about 0.6 K/day. The exact fractions being absorbed within clouds and by

the “clear” atmosphere are presently debated (Cess et al., 1995; Ramanathan et al., 1995; Pilewskie and Valero,

1995; Stephens, 1996) with the role of aerosols in clear sky atmosphere and of cloud inhomogeneities recently

coming to the forefront to explain this excess absorption not properly accounted by the current generation of radi-

ation schemes in GCMs (e.g., Cairns et al., 2000). Part of the solar energy input to the surface (between 155 and

180 W m-2 depending on how much is actually absorbed within the atmosphere) is returned to the atmosphere by

emission of terrestrial longwave radiation in the 4 to 100 wavelength range, but this emission (about 63 W m-

2, difference between 390 W m-2, the longwave upward emission of the surface and 327 W m-2, the longwave

downward emission of the atmosphere) does not fully compensate for the solar flux into the surface. The deficit of

about 106 W m-2 is compensated by turbulent transport of latent heat (for about 90 W m-2) and sensible heat (for

about 16 W m-2) from the surface to the atmosphere. The existence of a radiative balance at ToA and of a radiative

imbalance at the surface implies that the atmosphere itself is a net source of terrestrial longwave radiation to com-

pensate for the warming by the solar heating, latent heat release and sensible heat flux. Thus the atmosphere cools

through emssion of longwave radiation by about 1.6 K/day.

In the above discussion, only the figures of the radiation budget at ToA are known with some degree of accuracy

thanks to some decades of satellite measurements. Estimates of the components of the energy budget at the surface

are more difficult to obtain due to the lack of global coverage by conventional observation systems and to the alrge

uncertainties in the ongoing tentative determination of these quantities from satellite measurements.

2.3  Time and space variations of the solar zenith angle and their consequences

The solar zenith angle is the angle between the vertical at a given point on the Earth and the Sun’s direction. Its

cosine, , which is the relevant parameter for radiative computations can be computed knowing the latitude, the

longitude, the time of the year, and the time of the day.  influences the radiation transfer in two ways:

• the amount of energy received at ToA is the product of the solar constant by a factor depending on

the time of the year ( ) and by if is positive and zero otherwise (see Fig. 2 );

• the atmospheric mass encountered by a solar beam is proportional to  (for ).

Therefore, a diminishing means not only less input at ToA but also more scattering and absorption within the

atmosphere, therefore an even smaller solar flux at the surface. The time variations of are the daily cycle and

the yearly aseasonal cycle, which induce cyclic temperature variations and many specific patterns in the instanta-

neous weather. But the most important factor of influence of radiation on the weather is linked to its spece varia-

tions. Due to a better insolation of the equatorial belt than of the polar regions, which is not compensated by the

terrestrial longwave output, the equatorial region is warmer than the polar ones. This situation has two major con-

sequences for the weather:

• the same pressure layers are thicker at the equator than at the poles; since the sea level pressure is

observed to be uniformly distributed due to friction in the planetary boundary layer, and according

to Buys–Ballot’s law, the zonal mean wind regime is of zonal westerlies, therefore the atmosphere

precedes the Earth in its rotation;

• there is a need to transport heat from the equatorial to the polar regions. This transport is partly

realized by the oceans, partly by the atmosphere, But a simple zonal circulation does not allow the

atmosphere to fulfill this role and disturbances have to develop.

These last two points clearly indicate what is required from a radiation scheme in a large-scale numerical model of

the atmosphere: first a good estimate of the pole–equator radiative imbalance, second an accurate partition of the

poleward transport of heat between oceans and atmosphere.

In the tropics, the mean annual net heating of about 60 W m-2 is the sum of a 320 W m-2 heating by absorption of

solar radiation and a 260 W m-2 cooling by emission of longwave radiation. This net heating of only about 20% of

the available solar input (the remaining 80% heat the tropical surface) is the driving force for the general circulation

of the atmosphere and oceans. Therefore a 10% systematic error in the column absorbed solar radiation or in the

longwave emission may potentailly translate into a factor 5 larger (i.e., 50%) change in the poleward transport of

heat.

Also important is the dipole-like deposit of radiative energy in the earth–atmosphere system. As a whole, the trop-

osphere is subject to a net radiative cooling (of about 106 W m-2, Ramanathan, 1987), whereas the surface is subject

to a net radiative heating of the same amplitude. Here again a 10% systematic error in the amplitude of this dipole

will directly affect the destabilization of the troposphere, i.e., the fundamental drive for the tropospheric convec-

tion.

These questions may seem mainly related to climate studies, especially those performed with coupled ocean–at-

mosphere models. However the previous argument is also relevant to NWP modelling. NWP models are integrated

with an analysed non-interactive sea-surface temperature, which provides the right oceanic heat transport. In the

past, most NWP (and climate) models were using cloudiness fixed and/or zonally averaged to get the right answer

for the pole-equator radiative gradient. Nowadays, NWP and climate GCMs have interactive cloudiness and cloud-

radiation processes, as early satellite observations have shown the longitudinal gradients of radiative heating to be

of the same magnitude as the latitudinal gradients, due to the cloud distribution (Stephens and Webster, 1979).

Such gradients are illustrated in Figs. 3 to 6 , which present averaged over the summer 1987 (June–July–August)

the different components of the radiation budget derived from ERBE measurements. Fig. 3 displays the total and

clear-sky absorbed SW radiation whereas Fig. 4 presents the reflected SW radiation. The clear-sky fields obtained

by retaining the data only when clouds were found to be absent from the field of view of the satellite are highly

zonal over the oceans, with only the land surface albedo differing with the various land types introducing marked

departures. In comparison, the total fields clearly show the impact of the cloudiness with higher albedo (smaller

absorption) in the ITCZ, the Indian monsoon and over the storm track. Minimum albedo (maximum absorption) is

found over the relatively clear-sky subtropics, except over the extended low-level (stratocumulus) cloud decks on

the western facades of the continents (California, Peru, Namibia). Fig. 5 presents the total and clear-sky outgoing

longwave radiation for the same months. This field also displays the impact of the clouds, this time mainly of the

high-level cloudiness usually linked to convection in the ITCZ or over the Indian monsoon area. Over the equatorial

Pacific, the clear-sky OLR is less zonal than its SW counterpart indicating the role of moister atmospheres over the

west part than over the eastern part of the basin. Fig. 6 presents the shortwave and longwave cloud forcing, i.e.,

the difference between clear-sky and total fluxes. In the shortwave, clouds with their reflecting effect are responsi-

ble for a cooling of the atmosphere-surface system, through a decrease of the energy available for heating. On the

opposite, in the longwave, clouds contribute to a heating of the atmosphere by trapping the radiation coming from

the surface and the lower layers of the atmosphere and by emitting at the cold temperatures representative of the

higher clouds.

Cloud-radiation interactions are now thought to be of importance not only for mesoscale phenomena (the sea

breeze is the best but not the only example of intercation between radiation and surface discontinuities to create

local dynamical circulations), but also for synoptic scale phenomena such as the onset of the Indian monsoon

(Webster and Stephens, 1980).

Finally, some systematic errors of a NWP model can be traced back to a deficient radiation transfer parametrization

and at least partially corrected by an improved representation of the cloud-radiation interactions in the model

(Morcrette, 1990).

insolation (343 W m-2), solar radiation reflected by the whole atmosphere-surface system (106 W m-2), and

outgoing longwave radiation (237 W m-2) are obtained from satellite data (Ramanathan, 1987). The other

quantites in the figure are obtained from various published mode and empirical estimates, and might still be

fraught with uncertainties. The quantities include: absorption of solar radiation at the surface (169 W m-2),

downward longwave radiation at the surface emitted by the atmosphere (327 W m-2), upward longwave radiation

emitted by the surface (390 W m-2), and the turbulent heat fluxes from the surface,  the latent heat flux (90 W

m-2) and  the sensible heat flux (16 W m-2).

Generally, radiation is considered to be the process of electromagnetic waves propagating through a medium (nor-

adequately described by classical theory and require the use of quantum mechanics, which treats radiation as the

propagation and interaction of photons. One characteristic property of radiation is its wavelength, A classification

of radiation according to wavelength is presented in Fig. 7  (from Liou, 1980).

Wavelength , frequency , and wavenumber are related through the relation , where is
the speed of light ( m s-1 ). The sensitivity of the human eye is confined to a rather small interval

from 0.4 to 0.7 (micrometres) known as the visible region. However, most of the atmospheric exchange of

radiative energy  occurs from the ultraviolet (from about 0.2 ) to the infrared (around 100 ).

In atmospheric studies, two quantities are generally used, the flux per unit area in W m-2 and the specific intensity

or radiance, i.e., the radiative energy per time through unit area into a given solid angle, in W m-2 sr-1.

3.2  Derivation of the monochromatic radiative transfer equation (RTE)

The following discussion concerns the transfer equation for monochromatic radiation in its basic form for a plane-

parallel, horizontally homogeneous atmosphere (Chandrasekhar, 1960).

In GCM applications, the radiation field is computed without accounting for polarization effects, and assuming sta-

tionarity (no explicit dependence on time). Only the point where radiation is considered, the direction of propaga-

tion, and the frequency matter for the problem. Fig. 8 presents schematically the different contributions to the

specific intensity at a given point P enclosed by an infinitesimally small cyclindrical element of length , of cross-

section , and of an orientation expressed in terms of two angles, i.e., , with respect to the -axis and , the

angle between the projection of the direction onto the plane and the -axis itself. For a horizontally homo-

geneous atmospheric slice, the location of point P is given by its height above ground (or any other suitable co-

ordinate). Let us consider the various sources and sinks of radiative energy in this cyclindrical element:

3.2 (a)  Extinction. The radiance entering the cylinder at one end will be partially extinguished

within the volume, proportionally to the amount of matter encountered, thus contributing a negative increment of

radiative energy

where is the monochromatic extinction coefficient (units m-1) and is the solid angle differential

element.

3.2 (b)  Scattering. Another contribution to a change in radiative energy in the volume is caused by the scat-

tering of radiation from any other direction into the direction of the considered beam, i.e.,

,

where is the monochromatic scattering coefficient, is the solid angle differential element for the

originating beam, is the normalized phase function, which represents the probability for a

photon incoming from direction to be scattered in direction . Since scattered radiation may

originate from any direction, we have to integrate over all possible angle combinations of  and .

The direct (unscattered) solar beam is generally considered separately and not contained in the intensity of the

direction considered. Thus scattering of the solar beam into the direction of interest is as well separate from the

If we define as the ratio of the absorption to the extinction coefficient and the single scat-

tering albedo , we finally obtain the monochromatic RTE for a plane parallel, hori-

zontally homogeneous atmosphere in the coordinate system given by (  as

In principle, the RTE derived above allows the complete problem of the radiative transfer in a NWP to be solved if

the specific intensities are known for all model layers, i.e., including the surface, all directions and all wave-

numbers of the spectrum. But in this present form, the RTE is much too complicated to be used as such in a NWP

or climate GCM. We will now consider various simplications linked either to the basic laws of physics or to the

very specific circumstances prevailing in the Earth’s atmosphere.

3.3  Basic laws

3.3 (a)  Planck’s law. The energy of an atomic oscillator is quantized, as is any change of energy state. The

change of the energy state by one quantum number corresponds to an amount of energy (either radiated or ab-

sorbed) of where is the frequency of the atomic oscillator and J s

is Planck’s constant. For a large sample of atomic oscillators where the distribution of energy levels follows Boltz-

mann statistics, one can derive Planck’s function for the emission of radiant energy by a black body (see details in

Liou, 1980)

,

where is the wavelength of emission, is Boltzmann constant, J K-1, is the velocity

of light in a vacuum, and  is the absolute temperature of the black body (in K).

3.3 (b)  Wien’s law. The dependence of on for various temperatures is shown in Fig. 9 . The dotted

line in the diagram marks the wavelength of the maximum intensity. It increases with the temperature of the black

body and its variation follows Wien’s displacement law. Extreme values of the Planck function are defined by

.

With and , and defining and , the previous condition

can be rewritten as

.

After some manipulation (see, e.g., Liou, 1980), we obtain a transcendental equation ,which

can be shown to give  provided that .

This translates into .

Wien’s displacement law considerably simplifies the radiation transfer problem in the Earth’s atmosphere. Atmos-

pheric and surface temperatures are typically in the 200–300 K range and the maximum emission occurs in the 10

to 15 wavelength range. On the other hand, the Sun, the Earth’s external source of radiative energy emits most

of its energy at wavelengths around about 0.5 corresponding to an equivalent black body at about 6000 K. At

the mean Earth–Sun distance of km, the monochromatic radiant intensity received from the Sun over a

wide range of the spectrum is much less than the emission by the Earth’s atmosphere system at equivalent wave-

lengths. The cross-over point is approximately at 3.5 . For wavelengths lower than 3.5 , the terrestrial emis-

sion is negligible and so is the energy received from the Sun at ToA for wavelengths larger than 3.5 . For this

reason, when designing a radiation scheme for application to the Earth’s atmosphere, one may separate the transfer

problem in two parts, the shortwave and longwave radiative transfer, by dealing independently with the sources and

sinks that are important for each part of the spectrum.

3.3 (c)  Stefan-Boltzmann law. The total radiant intensity of a black body follows from a spectral integration

of the Planck function over all wavelengths, i.e.,

Using the same substitutions as when deriving Wien’s displacement law, we get

.

The integral term has the value , so we finally obtain Stefan–Boltzmann law

,

where W m-2 K-4 is Stefan’s constant. The total emitted flux given by this equation already

implies that the angular integration over the total radiant intensity is performed assuming an isotropic emission by

the black body (which is verified), leading to the factor .

3.3 (d)  Kirchhoff’s law. The emissivity of a medium is the ratio of the emitted energy to the Planck func-

tion at the temperature of the medium for a given wavelength . If the absorptivity is defined as the amount of

energy absorbed at that wavelength divided by the appropriate Planck function, Kirchhoff’s law states that the two

quantites are equal, i.e.,

.

A black body is defined by its ability to absorb all the incoming radiation at a given wavelength and therefore to

emit isotropically according to Planck function; then for a black body . In contrast, grey bodies

absorb and emit only partially with values of  and being less than unity.

The Earth’s atmosphere is far from being a medium with a uniform temperature distribution. However, the assump-

tion of a thermodynamic equilibrium ( ) is still valid in a local sense, since at least for the lower part of the

atmosphere (approximately below 40 km), collision between molecules is a process efficient enough to maintain a

local thermodynamic balance.

In Subsection 3.2, the derivation of the RTE and its formal solution were carried out monochromatically. It is now

necessary to consider the spectral variations of the various parameters (scattering and extinction coefficients, single

scattering albedo and phase function). By contrast with the emission of a black body which displays smooth var-

iations with temperature and wavelength, the absorption, emission and scattering by particles and gases give rise

to highly variable spectra of parameters.

3.4  The spectral absorption by gases

Any moving particle has kinetic energy as a result of its motion in space. This energy is equal to and is not

quantized. However molecules have other radiative energy types, which can be described from a mechanical model

of the molecules. The absorption of radiative energy by gases is an interaction process between molecules and pho-

tons and thus obey quantum mechanics laws. Absorption and emission take place when the atoms and molecules

undergo transitions from one energy state to another. In contrast to “grey” absorbers such as solid particles and liq-

uids, which absorb radiation fairly uniformly with respect to wavelengths (a consequence of the dense packing of

molecules and atoms in these), the absorption and emission by atmospheric gases are highly selective with regards

to wavelength, due to the selection rules that govern the transitions.

The gaseous absorption spectrum can be categorized in three parts according to the total (radiative) energy of the

molecules:

The molecule may rotate or revolve about an axis through its centre of gravity. The relatively low rotational energy

of the molecules is associated with wavelengths in the far infrared (i.e., mm). In this spectral region absorp-

tion lines are well separated and are related to the transformation from one discrete rotational state into another.

The atoms of the molecule are bounded by certain forces, but the individual atoms can vibrate about their equilib-

rium position relative to each other. A combination of rotational and vibrational energy transformations causes ab-

sorption lines in the 1 to 20 µm region. The coexistence of both types leads to very complex structures (e.g., the
the vibration-rotation band of H2O around 6.3 ) as an enormous number of lines are involved, which partially

overlap each other.

Towards shorter wavelengths, the third form of energy transformation, the change of the energy level of electrons,

occurs and this change in the electronic levels of energy increases further the complexity of the spectrum (e.g., O2
bands in the ultraviolet).

3.4 (a)  Line width. Each spectral line corresponds exactly to one form of energy transformation and should

in principle be discontinuous due to the discrete energy levels. However, due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle

(natural broadening), the collision between molecules (Lorentz or pressure broadening), and Doppler effects (re-

sulting from the thermal velocity of atoms and molecules), absorbed and emitted emission is not strictly monochro-

matic, but is rather associated with spectral lines of finite width. Whereas the natural broadening affects the line

width only marginally, the other two have a marked impact on the shape of the spectral lines and therefore on the

absorption process itself.

The Doppler broadening occurs due to the thermal agitation within the gas. For a molecule of mass radiating at

frequency , with a velocity component in the line of sight following a Maxwell–Boltzmann probability dis-

tribution

the absorption coefficient of such a Doppler broadened line is

The pressure broadening is due to collisions between the molecules, which modify their energy levels. The result-

3.4 (b)  Line intensity. The intensity of a line varies with temperature, due to the variation with of the sta-

tistical population of the energy levels of a molecule.

where is the energy of the lower state of the transition, is an exponent the value of which depends on the

shape of the molecule (1 for CO2, 3/2 for H2O, 5/2 for O3) and is the reference temperature at which the line

intensities are known (and compiled, usually 296 K).

An example of the fine scales involved is given in Fig. 11 taken from Fisher (1985). The figure shows the 15

band of CO2 at varying spectral resolution. Even on a wavenumber interval as small as 0.01 cm
-1 (the 15 band

covers roughly 450 to 800 cm-1), the absorption varies over the full range from total absorption to total transmis-

sion. It is this extreme spectral dependency of gaseous absorption that makes an explicit integration of the mono-

chromatic RTE and subsequent spectral integration of fluxes quite a lengthy task, even on the fast super-computers,

and renders it impossible for operational use in a NWP model. Very detailed models of the radiation transfer exist,

which performs the spectral integration over wavenumber intervals the width of which is typically smaller than the

half-width of an individual line. These so-called “line-by-line” calculations can serve as reference for more approx-

imate methods. At present the number of known spectral lines for gases existing in the Earth’s atmosphere is of the

order of 300,000 (Rothman et al., 1998).

Figs. 12 to 14 show the spectral dependency of the gaseous absorption coefficient for the three main atmospheric

absorbers H2O, CO2 and O3 over the longwave part of the spectrum. The values are derived from an evaluation of

spectroscopic data over 5 cm-1 intervals between 0 and 1110 cm-1, 10 cm-1 between 1110 and 2200 cm-1, and 20

cm-1 beyond 2200 cm-1, with the narrow-band model of Morcrette and Fouquart (1985). Similarly, Figs. 15 to 17

show the temperature dependency of the absorption coefficients for the same absorbers in terms of

and , with corresponding to ,

the absorption coefficient at 250 K.

Fig. 18 shows the spectral dependency of the gaseous absorption coefficient for the three main absorbers over the

whole range of wavenumbers relevant for atmospheric energy budget. To put the importance of of the absorption

lines for the atmospheric transfer in perspective, the normalized Planck function for 6000 K (solar emission) and

255 K (terrestrial emission) are plotted underneath. It is obvious that H2O is the most important absorber in the

terrestrial spectrum leaving a transparent region only around 10 . The so called 9.6 band of ozone partially

fills this gap. However, as the amount of O3 in the atmosphere is not very large and is concentrated in the strato-

sphere, the atmosphere is fairly transparent (with respect to gaseous absorption) in this region of the spectrum

called the atmospheric window. Absorption effect of trace gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and

chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and CFC-12) are mainly felt in this spectral region due to the small background ab-

sorption.

Towards longer wavelengths this window is bounded by CO2 absorption (the 15 band) and the H2O rotation

band. Towards shorter wavelengths but still in the terrestrial radiation, we find the vibration-rotation of H2O around

6.3 . At very short wavelengths (in the ultraviolet region below 0.25 ), ozone absorbs almost completely

the solar radiation penetrating the atmosphere. However, in the so called visible (0.4–0.7 ) and near-infrared

(0.7–4 ) regions of the solar spectrum, solar radiation is weakened only by H2O and more modestly by CO2
and other trace gases (NO2, O2, CH4, N2O, not shown in Fig. 18 )

3.5  The spectral scattering by particles

A primary electromagnetic wave encountering a particle will excite a secondary wave originating at the particle’s

location. Such process can occur at all wavelengths covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum. The scattering

efficiency will depend on the size, the geometrical shape and on the real part of its complex refractive index, where-

as the absorption efficiency will essentially depends on the imaginary part of the refractive index. Particles in the

atmosphere are generally at such distances from each other that the radiation originating from individual particles

is incoherent (i.e., no interference betwwen scattered radiation from different particles). Therefore the field of scat-

tered radiation due to an ensemble of particles is the sum of the fields from the individual scattering processes. At-

mospheric constituents can be separated into different broad categories according to their size: Molecules have a

typical radius of 10-4 µm, the so called aerosols range from 0.01 to 10 , cloud particles from 5 to 200 , rain
drops and hail particles up to 10-2 m.

The relative intensity of the scattering pattern depends on the so-called Mie parameter where is the

radius of the particle (assumed spherical) and is the wavelength.

3.5 (a)  Rayleigh scattering. The size of air molecules is small compared to the wavelength of radiation in the

Earth’s atmosphere. So in a simple model one can assume that molecules interacting with an electromagnetic wave

start to vibrate and thereby radiate as linear oscillators. By considering spherical air molecules statistically distrib-

uted in a volume, Lord Rayleigh derived (1871) the phase function of such molecules

Rayleigh scattering being conservative ( ), the integral over the phase function is unity, i.e.,

.

It is completely symmetric ( ) (see Fig. 19 ), and the scattering coefficient, i.e., the probability of a photon

being scattered in a volume is for Rayleigh scattering proportional to the density of air and inversely proportional

to the fourth power of the wavelength. The visible consequence of this spectral dependency is the blueness of the

sky, caused by the preferential scattering of shorter wavelengths in a clear atmosphere. The rapid decrease of the

Rayleigh scattering coefficient with wavelength simplifies the transfer problem for the Earth’s atmosphere, since

Rayleigh scattering can be completely neglected for the terrestrial part of the spectrum.

3.5 (b)  Mie scattering. The size of aerosols and or cloud droplets is comparable to the wavelengths at which

the radiative energy is dominant in the Earth’s atmosphere. Rayleigh scattering is not applicable anymore. Photons

encountering a particle off such size will excite secondary waves in various parts of the particles. These waves are

coherent and therefore interference causes partial extinction in some directions and enhancement in others. For this

reason, scattering by aerosols and cloud particles is far from being isotropic, with a pronounced preference for the

forward direction. Under the assumption of spherical particle shape, Mie theory can be used to derive the phase

function (see Subsection 3.2 (b)) for a given size distribution of particles. Unfortunately, there is no analytical so-

lution and the result is obtained in the form of an infinite series of Bessel functions. A normalized phase function

for a standard aerosol model (after Quenzel, 1985) is shown in Fig. 20 .

For detailed calculations involving radiances (e.g., in remote sensing applications) the phase function is usually

developed into Legendre polynomials with up to several hundred terms to get the true angular representation

When dealing with the impact of scatterers on fluxes, only the very few terms necessary for an adequate

description of the hemispherically integrated fluxes are required and one can use some analytic formula such as

Henyey–Greenstein function

where  is the asymmetry factor, the first moment of the expansion

.

When , all the energy is backscattered, all energy appears in the forward direction, and

corresponds to an equipartition between the forward and backward spaces defined by a plane perpendicular to the

incoming direction

In large-scale atmospheric models, a scattering medium (cloud or aerosols) is usually characterized by its single

scattering albedo (see Subsection 3.2 (d)) and its phase function (see Subsection 3.2 (b)) and its optical thickness

(see Subsection 3.2 (b)). For very large droplets the laws of geometric optics apply making the calculations very

simple. In the Earth’s atmosphere a large variety of droplet sizes can be found depending very much on the type

of cloud they are embedded in. Stephens (1979) quotes radii ranging from 2.25 for stratus clouds to 7.5

for stratocumulus. Han et al. (1994) derived radii for water clouds from satellite measurements between 6 and 15

. Most radiative transfer schemes in use in GCMs reuiqre only the volume extinction coefficient (related to the

optical thickness), the single scattering albedo and the forward scattered fraction of radiation (or asymmetry fac-

tor). All these quantities as given by Stephens (1979) are plotted in Figs. 21  to 24  for various cloud types.

The most complex calculation of the phase function is required for the treatment of ice crystals. The application

of Mie theory is not possible since the assumption of a spherical shape is certainly invalidated in this case. Ice crys-

tals take all sorts of shapes ranging from thin needles to complex combinations of hollow prisms forming snow-

flakes. If a specific shape is assumed for the ice crystals, geometrical optics may be used for particles that are large

compared to the wavelength (Takano and Liou, 1989; Ebert and Curry, 1992; Fu and Liou, 1993; Fu et al., 1999,

1988, 1999). However, the results depend very much on the orientation of the crystals relative to the direction of

propagation of the radiation. At present, it is almost impossible for a GCM-type radiation scheme to take into ac-

count such detailed and complicated dependencies of the optical properties, specially as the GCM is still far from

providing the reuiqred information necessary to initiate such calculations.

In the cruder form of parametrization currently used, the ice water loading of the clouds is prognosed by the cloud

scheme and thus provides an interactive optical thickness. The effective dimension of the particles is diagnosed

from temperature and/or the type of process from which the cloud is originating (large-scale condensation or con-

vection), but the single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor are specified.

4. RADIATION SCHEMES IN USE AT ECMWF

4.1  The operational longwave scheme (as of March 2000)

The longwave radiation is an upgrade from the original scheme defined by Morcrette et al. (1986), Morcrette (1990,

1991, 1993).

Assuming a non-scattering atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium,  is given by

(1)

where is the monochromatic radiance at wavenumber at level , propagating in a direction (the

angle that this direction makes with the vertical), where and is the monochromatic

transmission through a layer whose limits are at and seen under the same angle , with . The

subscript ‘surf’ refers to the earth’s surface.

After separating the upward and downward components (indicated by superscripts + and –, respectively), and in-

tegrating by parts, we obtain the radiation transfer equation as it is actually estimated in the longwave part of the

radiation code

(2)

where, taking benefit of the isotropic nature of the longwave radiation, the radiance of (5.3) has been replaced

by the Planck function in units of flux, (here, and elsewhere, is assumed to always includes

the factor). is the surface temperature, that of the air just above the surface, is the temperature

at pressure-level , that at the top of the atmospheric model. The transmission is evaluated as the

radiance transmission in a direction to the vertical such that is the diffusivity factor (Elsasser, 1942).

The integrals in (2) are evaluated numerically, after discretization over the vertical grid, considering the atmosphere

as a pile of homogeneous layers. As the cooling rate is strongly dependent on local conditions of temperature and

pressure, and energy is mainly exchanged with the layers adjacent to the level where fluxes are calculated, the con-

tribution of the distant layers is simply computed using a trapezoidal rule integration, but the contribution of the

adjacent layers is evaluated with a two-point Gaussian quadrature, thus at the  level,

The longwave spectrum is divided into six spectral regions.

1) 0 – 350  & 1450 – 1880

2) 500 – 800

3) 800 – 970  & 1110 – 1250

atmospheric window, the 9.6 band of O3, the 25 “window” region, and the wings of the vibration-

rotation band of H2O, respectively.

Integration of (2) over wavenumber within the spectral region gives the upward and downward fluxes as

The formulation accounts for the different temperature dependencies involved in atmospheric flux calculations,

namely that on , the temperature at the level where fluxes are calculated, and that on , the temperature that

governs the transmission through the temperature dependence of the intensity and half-widths of the lines

absorbing in the concerned spectral region.

The band transmissivities are non-isothermal accounting for the temperature dependence that arises from the wav-

enumber integration of the product of the monochromatic absorption and the Planck function. Two normalized

band transmissivities are used for each absorber in a given spectral region: the first one for calculating the first right-

hand-side. term in (2), involving the boundaries; it corresponds to the weighted average of the transmission func-

tion by the Planck function

the second one for calculating the integral term in (2) is the weighted average of the transmission function by the

derivative of the Planck function

(7)

where  is the pressure weighted amount of absorber.

In the scheme, the actual dependence on is carried out explicitly in the Planck functions integrated over the

spectral regions. Although normalized relative to or , the transmissivities still depend on ,

both through Wien’s displacement of the maximum of the Planck function with temperature and through the tem-

perature dependence of the absorption coefficients. For computational efficiency, the transmissivities have been de-

veloped into Pade approximants

(8)

where is an effective amount of absorber which incorporates the diffusivity factor ,

the weighting of the absorber amount by pressure , and the temperature dependence of the absorption

coefficients.

The function  takes the form

(9)

The temperature dependence due to Wien’s law is incorporated although there is no explicit variation of the

coefficients and with temperature. These coefficients have been computed for temperatures between 187.5

and 312.5 K with a 12.5 K step, and transmissivities corresponding to the reference temperature the closest to the

pressure weighted temperature  are actually used in the scheme.

The effect on absorption of the Doppler broadening of the lines (important only for pressure lower than 10 hPa) is

included simply using the pressure correction method proposed by Fels (1979) and incorporated by Giorgetta and

Morcrette (1995).

The incorporation of the effects of clouds on the longwave fluxes follows the treatment discussed by Washington

and Williamson (1977). Whatever the state of the cloudiness of the atmosphere, the scheme starts by calculating

emissivity unity. Let and the upward and downward fluxes when such a cloud is present in the

layer of the atmosphere. Downward fluxes above the cloud, and upward fluxes below the cloud, are assumed

to be given by the clear-sky values

(10)

Upward fluxes above the cloud ( for ) and downward fluxes below it ( for )

can be expressed with expressions similar to (3) provided the boundary terms are now replaced by terms

corresponding to  possible temperature discontinuities between the cloud and the surrounding air

where is now the total Planck function (integrated over the whole longwave spectrum) at level , and

and are the longwave fluxes at the upper and lower boundaries of the cloud. Terms under the integrals

correspond to exchange of energy between layers in clear-sky atmosphere and have already been computed in the

first step of the calculations. This step is repeated for all cloudy layers. The fluxes for the actual atmosphere (with

semi-transparent, fractional and/or multi-layered clouds) are derived from a linear combination of the fluxes

calculated in previous steps with some cloud overlap assumption in the case of clouds present in several layers.

boundary condition for downward fluxes above the highest cloud.

The maximum-random overlap assumption is operationally used in the ECMWF model, and the cloudy upward

 and downward  fluxes are obtained as

In case of semi-transparent clouds, the fractional cloudiness entering the calculations is an effective cloud cover

equal to the product of the emissivity due to the condensed water and the gases in the layer by the horizontal

coverage of the cloud layer, with the emissivity, , related to the condensed water amount by

, a convenient variable when the energy source is outside the medium

(16)

is the extinction coefficient, equal to the sum of the scattering coefficient of the aerosol (or cloud

particle absorption coefficient ) and the purely molecular absorption coefficient . The diffuse radiance

is governed by the radiation transfer equation

(17)

is the incident solar irradiance in the direction , is the single scattering albedo ( )

and is the scattering phase function which defines the probability that radiation coming from

direction ( ) is scattered in direction ( ). The shortwave part of the scheme, originally developed byr
and Bonnel (1980) solves the radiation transfer equation and integrates the fluxes over the whole

shortwave spectrum between 0.2 and 4 . Upward and downward fluxes are obtained from the reflectance and

transmittances of the layers, and the photon-path-distribution method allows to separate the parametrization of the

scattering processes from that of the molecular absorption.

Solar radiation is attenuated by absorbing gases, mainly water vapour, uniformly mixed gases (oxygen, carbon di-

oxide, methane, nitrous oxide) and ozone, and scattered by molecules (Rayleigh scattering), aerosols and cloud

particles. Since scattering and molecular absorption occur simultaneously, the exact amount of absorber along the

photon path length is unknown, and band models of the transmission function cannot be used directly as in long-

wave radiation transfer (see Subsection 4.1). The approach of the photon path distribution method is to calculate

Absorption by ozone is also taken into account, but since ozone is located at low pressure levels for which

molecular scattering is small and Mie scattering is negligible, interactions between scattering processes and ozone

absorption are neglected. Transmission through ozone is computed using (22) where  the amount of ozone is

is the diffusivity factor (see Subsection 4.1), and is the magnification factor ( krr 1967) used
instead of  to account for the sphericity of the atmosphere at very small solar elevations

(23)

To perform the spectral integration, it is convenient to discretize the solar spectral interval into subintervals in

which the surface reflectance can be considered as constant. Since the main cause of the important spectral

variation of the surface albedo is the sharp increase in the reflectivity of the vegetation in the near infrared, and

since water vapour does not absorb below 0.68 , the shortwave scheme considers two spectral intervals, one

for the visible (0.2–0.68 ), one for the near infrared (0.68–4.0 ) parts of the solar spectrum. This cut-off at

0.68 also makes the scheme more computationally efficient, in as much as the interactions between gaseous

absorption (by water vapour and uniformly mixed gases) and scattering processes are accounted for only in the

near-infrared interval.

4.2 (a)  Vertical integration. Considering an atmosphere where a fraction (as seen from the surface or

the top of the atmosphere) is covered by clouds (the fraction depends on which cloud-overlap assumption

is assumed for the calculations), the final fluxes are given as a weighted average of the fluxes in the clear sky and

in the cloudy fractions of the column

where the subscripts ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ refer to the clear-sky and cloudy fractions of the layer, respectively. In

contrast to the scheme of  r r¡£¢ and Hollingsworth (1979), the fluxes are not obtained through the solution of a
system of linear equations in a matrix form. Rather, assuming an atmosphere divided into homogeneous layers,

the upward and downward fluxes at a given layer interface  are given by

As for their cloudy counterparts, and must account for the multiple reflections due to the layers

and  is the reflectance of the underlying medium  and  is the diffusivity factor.

Since interactions between molecular absorption and Rayleigh and aerosol scattering are negligible, the radiative

fluxes in a clear-sky atmosphere are simply those calculated from (24) and (41) attenuated by the gaseous trans-

missions (22).

4.2 (d)  Multiple reflections between layers. To deal properly with the multiple reflections between the surface

and the cloud layers, it should be necessary to separate the contribution of each individual reflecting surface to the

layer reflectance and transmittances in as much as each such surface gives rise to a particular distribution of ab-

sorber amount. In case of an atmosphere including cloud layers, the reflected light above the highest cloud con-

sists of photons directly reflected by the highest cloud without interaction with the underlying atmosphere, and of

photons that have passed through this cloud layer and undergone at least one reflection on the underlying atmos-

phere. In fact, (17) should be written

where and are the conservative fluxes and the distributions of absorber amount corresponding to the

different reflecting surfaces.
ÅÆÇÈÇ »ÉrÊ and Bonnel (1980) have shown that a very good approximation to this problem is obtained by evaluating
the reflectance and transmittance of each layer (using (34) and (40)) assuming successively a non-reflecting under-

lying medium ( ), then a reflecting underlying medium ( ). First calculations provide the contribu-

tion to reflectance and transmittance of those photons interacting only with the layer into consideration, whereas

the second ones give the contribution of the photons with interactions also outside the layer itself.

From those two sets of layer reflectance and transmittances ( ) and ( ) respectively, effective ab-

sorber amounts to be applied to computing the transmission functions for upward and downward fluxes are then

derived using (18) and starting from the surface and working the formulas upward

5. COMPARISONS WITH OBSERVATIONS

As for the representation of clouds, there is an imperative need to perform at least some of the validation on short-

time and limited space scales, before the drift in the GCM climate makes comparison with observations very dif-

ficult to interpret. Relative to other physical processes, the existence of reference models (LbLs) that have been or

can be validated against highly spectrally detailed measurements (such as those of spectrometer and interferometer,

present on ARM sites, or embarked on Nimbus-3) offers a very useful tool for validation. However, although cur-

rently done for LW, this approach is not really used for SW, because of the relative lack of highly spectrally detailed

measurements in the SW compared to LW, and therefore of carefully validated LbL models in the SW (Ramas-

wamy and Freidenreich, 1992).

The approach discussed above could also be used, albeit with more difficulties, for cloudy atmospheres. However,

for years, most of the validation effort for radiation transfer in cloudy atmospheres has dealt with comparison of

radiation fluxes at TOA with satellite-derived fluxes (Nimbus-7 Earth Radiation Budget, Earth Radiation Budget

Experiment). More often than not, this was often done without considering at the same time a validation of the

cloud characteristics so that tweaking the cloud properties (particularly, the relationships giving the cloud fraction

and cloud water loading in diagnostic cloud schemes) allowed an easy agreement with TOA fluxes, specially over

monthly mean time-scales. With the availability of carefully calibrated measurements of the radiation fluxes at the

surface (Baseline Station Radiation Network (Ohmura et al., 1998), Global Energy Balance Archive, NOAA-ARL

SURFace RADiation network), or as is the case with the ARM program, of radiation fluxes and relatively detailed

information on the state of the overlying atmosphere and some information on the cloud structure, systematic ver-

ification of the radiation fields produced by the ECMWF model at various stages in the forecasts can now be carried

out.

In the following, we present one example of such validation for a site where good quality surface radiation meas-

urements are available with a high frequency (such sites are available as part of the BSRN, SURFRAD or ARM

projects). For a weather forecast system, it is often preferable to use measurements not too remote in time, as the

analysis and forecast system undergoes regular improvement over the years. In this respect, the NOAA-ARL SUR-

Face RADiation network offers real-time availability of surface radiation measurements over 6 sites in the U.S.

Figure 5.1 compares the downward and upward LW radiation over Goodwin Creek, Mississippi, over the period

17 November to 15 December 1997, when a new physical parametrisation package was being tested. Fig. 26 shows

the corresponding downward SW radiation. As can be seen from the LW comparisons, the model is rather success-

ful at producing the observed variability in temperature at the surface (as seen from the upward LW radiation in

Fig. 25 , bottom panel) and in temperature, humidity, and cloud fraction in the lowest layers of the atmosphere (as

seen from the downward LW radiation in Fig. 25 , top panel). On the other hand, it appears less successful at han-

dling the amount of condensed water in clouds, with too small optical thickness translating in too large downward

SW radiation at the surface (Fig. 26 ). Next stage in this type of comparisons is to make sure that the fluxes are

computed for the proper vertical profiles of radiatively important quantities. Albeit obvious, this statement is very

difficult to be put in practice, as a comprehensive knowledge of all the atmospheric profiles is rarely attained (and

attainable). The ARM program is the best try in this direction, with, over the South Great Plains site in Oklahoma,

long time-series of surface radiation flux measurements, radiosoundings, synoptic observations, vertically integrat-

ed water vapour and cloud water measurements from a microwave radiometer, and vertical profiles of temperature,

humidity, and cloud water from the inversion of interferometer and cloud radar measurements. Figure 5.3 presents

the total column water vapour and cloud liquid water in December 1997 as observed by the Microwave Radiometer

and produced by the ECMWF model in a series of 31 operational forecasts all starting at 12 UTC. Between the 13

and 17 December, the sky is essentially clear. Fig. 28 compares the surface downward LW radiation observed dur-

ing these 5 days and computations by different radiation schemes from the forecast fields of temperature and hu-

midity. A difference of 5 to 8 W m-2 is systematically found between the pre-December’97 ECMWF radiation

scheme (old_EC) and the RRTM scheme. However, even this state-of-the-art radiation scheme underestimates the

observed flux by 10–15 W m-2, showing that, even this thought-to-be-simple comparison exercise is not straight-

forward. It is very likely that the model low-level temperature and humidity profiles are at the origin of these dis-

crepancies.

Another validation exercise involving the model radiation scheme is the verification of the cloud signature on TOA

radiances. Fig. 29 illustrates such comparison for the ERICA storm: the longwave window channel brightness tem-

perature/radiance is simulated from the model cloud, temperature and humidity fields using the methodology of

Morcrette (1991a).

6. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

Recent studies have focussed at the direct and/or indirect radiative impact of aerosols in climate simulations (Jous-

saume, 1990; Genthon, 1992; Boucher and Lohmann, 1995; Chylek et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995; Lohmann

and Feichter, 1997; Tegen et al., 1997; Timmreck et al., 1997; Cusack et al., 1998; Le Treut et al., 1998; Schulz et

al., 1998). Since the pioneering work of Tanre et al. (1984), the ECMWF model has included an annual mean, but

geographically distributed climatology of aerosols. The geographical distribution of the maritime, continental, ur-

ban and desert aerosols are given in Figs. 30 and 31 , where as the vertical distribution is illustrated in Fig. 32 . As

discussed in Cusack et al. (1998), the presence of these aerosols in the ECMWF model is certainly one of the rea-

sons why the surface downward SW radiation is less overestimated in the ECMWF model than in other leading

climate GCMs (Garratt, 1994; Garratt et al., 1998). However, a monthly specification of the aerosol distributions

or better a prognosed aerosol loading is a possible future development for the ECMWF model.

Recent studies by Wang and Rossow (1995, 1998) and Stubenrauch et al. (1997) have focussed at the potentially

large impact on the atmospheric circulation linked to uncertainties in the vertical distribution of clouds and related

radiative heating/cooling rates. Similar results were also obtained with the ECMWF model (Morcrette and Jakob,

2000). Fig. 33 presents the cloud overlaps that the operational radiation scheme can handle. One-dimensional cal-

culations are performed for different cloud configurations often encountered in three-dimensional simulations. The

first one corresponds to a typical convective system and includes a convective tower of fractional cover 0.15 from

820 to 290 hPa topped by stratiform anvil of cover 0.4 and 70 hPa thick. The second case includes three layers of

stratiform cloud of cover 0.3 between 890 and 820 hPa (low-level), 640 and 545 hPa (middle-level), and 290 and

220 hPa (high-level), respectively. The profiles of the cloud longwave, shortwave and net radiative forcing for these

two cases are presented in Fig. 34 , left and right panels respectively. The cloud forcing term is simply the difference

between the heating obtained for the cloudy atmosphere minus the clear-sky heating. The different COAs are treat-

ed exactly in the LW part and only approximately in the SW part of the radiation scheme. Therefore, the LW MRN

and MAX results are essentially the same for case 1, and the same holds for the LW MRN and RAN results for case

2. In the SW, the agreement on the SW forcing profiles is also very good. In the first case (see Fig. 34 , left panels),

the anvil produces a strong LW cooling whereas a relative heating is found in the rest of the convective tower below.

Compared to MRN/MAX, the RAN LW shows a smaller cooling peak in the anvil, smaller heating below within

the tower, and larger warming in the clear PBL. All these features are consistent with the larger effective cloudiness

that the RAN assumption produces between any two cloudy layers. This larger effective cloudiness (i) prevents the

radiation from the lower atmospheric layers from escaping to space, thus the heating in the PBL, (ii) decreases the

possible radiative exchanges within the tower, thus the smaller radiative heating, and (iii) decreases the upward LW

flux at the base of the anvil, hence the smaller LW divergence in the anvil. Similarly, a stronger SW heating is linked

in RAN to the larger cloud fraction available to screen the downward radiation and to the more diffuse character of

this radiation in the cloudy fraction of the column. Consequently a smaller amount of SW radiation is available

below the cloud base and this translates into a relative cooling. The smaller heating of the anvil in RAN is linked

to the smaller SW flux divergence through a larger upward radiation due to the increased reflection on the larger

effective amount of lower level clouds.

In the second case (see Fig. 34 , right panels), each of the three stratiform cloud layers produces a LW cooling inside

and a LW heating immediately underneath. Differences between MAX and MRN/RAN results are consistent with

the smaller total effective cloudiness given by MAX. The cooling in the low-level cloud is reduced in MAX because

the middle- and high-level clouds prevent the radiation at the top of the low-level cloud from escaping to space.

Similarly, the cooling in the high-level cloud is increased in MRN/RAN because the low- and middle-level clouds

prevent the warmer radiation from the lower layers to reach the base of the high-level cloud. The smaller total

cloudiness in MAX also explains the smaller LW heating below the lowest cloud. In the SW, the difference in heat-

ing is very small within the clouds. The slightly larger relative cooling immediately below the clouds in MAX



Radiation Transfer

comes from the larger fraction of radiation being directly transmitted, as, in MRN/RAN, the radiation in the cloudy

fraction of the column is more diffuse and therefore more likely to be absorbed. The smaller SW heating of the

upper cloud with MRN/RAN is again linked to the increased reflection. These one-dimensional computations show

the validity of the treatment of the different COAs in the ECMWF radiation scheme. They also show the larger

impact of a change of COA on the LW than on the SW radiative profiles.

Fig. 35 presents the total cloudiness (TCC) averaged over the last three months (DJF) of the EPR simulations with

the MRN, MAX and RAN COAs. Not surprisingly, the set of MAX simulations display the minimum total cloud

cover at 0.609, followed by the MRN at 0.639, whereas the RAN simulations have a much larger total cloud cover

at 0.714. The increase from MRN to RAN (respectively, the decrease from MRN to MAX) is apparent over most

of the globe, but is more pronounced over the sub-tropics, particularly those of the Southern hemisphere. Are these

changes simply reflecting the different geometrical distribution of the cloud elements on the vertical or are they

linked to actual changes in the volume of the cloud elements? A simple check whether the cloud volume is actually

modified is obtained by diagnosing the total cloud cover for all sets of simulations and applying the operational

maximum-random overlap assumption to the various cloud elements. Fig. 36 presents the MRN-equivalent TCC

for the EPR experiments. The main result is that most of the change in TCC is not reflected in the MRN-equivalent

TCC, showing that a large fraction of the signal is due to the geometrical overlapping in the radiation scheme, and

not to a real significant change in the cloud volume.

Radiation transfer parametrisation is generally the most expensive in computer time among the physical parame-

trisations used in a GCM. In the ECMWF operational forecast model, full radiation computations are performed

only every 3 hours and on a reduced grid (1 point out of 4 along the longitude direction). Even so, radiation ac-

counts for about 15%t of the total cost of the model. Although such spatial and temporal sampling of the radiation

forcing does not appear detrimental on the short time scales encompassed in the operational analyses of meteoro-

logical observations and the 10-day forecasts made with the high resolution (TL319) ECMWF weather forecast

model (Fig. 37 for the anomaly correlation of the geopotential at 500 hPa, Figs. 38 and 39 for the mean error in

temperature at 850, 500, 200 and 50 hPa), the impact becomes systematic and (possibly) detrimental on seasonal

time-scales and/or at lower resolution (Morcrette, 2000). For example, Figures 6.11 and 6.12 present the zonal

mean cloudiness and temperature, with the operational configuration (S4T3h = spatial sampling 1 point out of 4 in

the tropics, full radiation calculation only every 3 hours), and the difference with configurations for which radiation

is either called at every grid point (S1) and/or for every time step (T1). When the radiation calculations are syn-

chronous with the rest of the physics (and of the model), the stability in the ITCZ is decreased, with a resultant

(small) increase in high-level clouds (Fig. 40 ), but a more spatially extensive decrease in stratospheric tempera-

tures (Fig. 41 ).

New algorithms are being tested based on the neural network approach of Cheruy et al. (1996) and Chevallier et

al. (2000a, 2000b), or on the linearized approach proposed by Chou and Neelin (1996), both of which introduce

major savings in computer time. They would therefore allow for more frequent and/or non spatially sampled radi-

ation calculations. For example, Fig. 42 present the bias and standard deviation of the LW cooling rates computed

by a neural network method relative to the operational LW scheme, whereas. Figs. 43 and 44 display standard

objective scores, the anomaly correlation of the geopotential at 500 hPa (Fig. 43 ) and the mean error in temperature

at various levels in the atmosphere (Fig. 44 ). Such results indicate that the neural network approach is potentially

a viable replacement. for traditional LW parametrizations.

Other areas of development concern the role of the cloud inhomo/heterogeneity on the model horizontal sub-grid

scale, and that of the vertical overlapping of cloud layers. On the first point, (not equivalent to a full account of the

three-dimensional cloud-induced radiative effects, but going away from the plane-parallel approach used over the

last 25 years), Tiedtke (1996) proposed a simple parametrisation of this effect, while Barker (1996, 1998) modified

a SW scheme similar to the ECMWF one and incorporated an approximate treatment of the impact of the liquid

water inhomogeneities via a gamma-distribution approach. Figs. 45 and 46 present the differences in transmissiv-

ity, reflectivity and absorptivity for some standard liquid and ice water clouds in the two spectral intervals of the

SW scheme. The impact is important over most of the range of optical thickness and for all quantities. Such an

“horizontal” effect, to be accounted for also in the LW part of the spectrum is likely to change the effect of the

clouds on the radiative distribution within the whole atmospheric column. In view of the large effects of the sub-

grid scale distribution of the condensed water on the radiative fluxes, it is likely that, in the coming years, GCMs

will incorporate an equation to at least diagnose this sub-grid scale variability and account for its effect on the ra-

diation fields.

Up to now, the validation of the large-scale radiative fields produced by a climate or a weather forecast GCM has

mainly consisted of checks on the total cloud cover, and related top of the atmosphere and surface longwave and

shortwave radiation fields. These fields (for example, Darnell et al., 1992; Gupta et al., 1993; Laszlo and Pinker,

1993; Li and Leighton, 1993; Rossow, 1993; Zhang et al., 1995) are provided by dedicated satellite observations

such as ERB (Stowe et al., 1989), ERBE (Harrison et al., 1988), ScaRaB (Kandel et al., 1998), CERES (Wielicki

et al., 1996) and/or operational satellite observations as part of ISCCP (Rossow et al., 1987). Although very useful,

these essentially two-dimensional (3-D if time history is considered) validation efforts are only a first step towards

what would really be required to ascertain the adequacy of the representation of the cloud-radiation interactions:

the 4-dimensional distribution of cloud volume and cloud water loading together with relevant 4-dimensional ra-

diation parameters: a real challenge for the future!
