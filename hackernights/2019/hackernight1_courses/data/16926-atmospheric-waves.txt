Atmospheric waves

1. INTRODUCTION

In order to understand the many and varied approximations and assumptions which are made in designing a nu-

merical model of the earths atmosphere (whether of small-scale features such as individual clouds, or mesoscale,

regional, global weather prediction or climate models), it is necessary to study the various wave motions which can

be present. The identification and appreciation of the mechanisms of these waves will allow us to isolate or elim-

inate certain wave types and to better understand the viability and effectiveness of commonly made approximations

such as assuming hydrostatic balance.

Here we will attempt to identify the basic atmospheric wave motions, to emphasise their most important properties

and their physical characteristics. Basic textbooks such as 'An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology' by Holton

or 'Numerical Prediction and Dynamic Meteorology' by Haltiner and Williams provide a good introduction and

complement this short course well. Whereas these textbooks treat each wave motion separately starting from dif-

ferent simplified equation sets, we will separate waves from a more complete equation set by various approxima-

tions made at later stages thus making it easier to relate the impact of a particular approximation on several wave

types. Nevertheless, to retain all wave types in the initial equation set is unmanageable and we will introduce sub-

sets of equations later.

We will restrict ourselves to neutral (non-amplifying, non-decaying) waves in which energy exchanges are oscil-

latory.

While the exact equations have been considerably simplified into a useful form for studies of atmospheric dynam-

ics, these simplified equations cannot be solved analytically except in certain special cases. The main difficulty aris-

es through the non-linear advective terms , etc. Although these terms can considerably modify the

linear solutions and are also physically significant because they represent transfer and feedback between different

scales of motion, the linearized equations (obtained by removing second-order advective terms) are useful for iden-

tifying the origin of distinct types of wave (acoustic, gravity and cyclone) in the equations. It should be understood

that although nonlinearity will modify the acoustic, gravity and long waves it will not introduce any additional

wave types. Since the origin of waves can be identified in the linearized equations and these can be solved analyt-

ically, useful methods for filtering individual modes can be determined.

2. BASIC EQUATIONS

The following mathematical analysis requires a choice of vertical coordinate. While it is common to use pressure

or a pressure-based vertical coordinate in large-scale modelling, this is not a necessary theoretical restriction and

we can write the equations in  (height),  (pressure) or ( ), as follows:

All partial derivatives respect their coordinate system.

Note that putting in (3), and elsewhere gives the familiar large-scale equation sets, but we

will not make this approximation at present. In principle the following linearized analysis can be done in any co-

ordinate; we will use height but much of this analysis has been done in pressure and sigma coordinates elsewhere

(e.g. Kasahara, 1974; Miller, 1974; Miller and White, 1984).

For simplicity we will suppose that the motion is independent of and neglect the variation of the Coriolis param-

eter with latitude ( ). Also we will consider small disturbances on an initially motionless atmos-

phere. A non-zero basic flow and restoration of  and non-zero  will be considered later.

In order to trace the effect of individual terms we will use ‘tracer parameters' which have the value

1 but can be set to zero to eliminate the relevant term.

We define ,where  and  is a reference pressure (e.g. 105 Pa), and write

basic horizontally stratified atmosphere with . Since we consider small perturbations such that prod-

ucts of perturbations can be negelcted and that , ,  we can write (1)–(5) as:

EXERCISE:

Derive Eq. (19)

The coefficients � ��� in (17)–(21) are independent of and , so these equations are linear and, in an
unbounded region, admit solutions of the separable form where can be a complex func-

tion, and and are the -wavenumber and the frequency respectively. Complex values of would imply am-

plifying/decaying waves which are not considered here.

The full solution is the appropriate Fourier sum of terms of this form over all wavenumbers. Since we shall be

looking at individual waves we choose to discuss individual wave components rather than the Fourier sum.

Inserting , , and the corresponding expressions for ,

, , and into (17)-(21), and noting that the operators , can be replaced by and , re-

spectively, yields the following set of ordinary differential equations in the unknowns :

One solution of (33) is , and the corresponding dynamical structure can be determined by setting in

(22)–(26) to give and . This is geostrophic motion in the -direction and is also

exactly hydrostatic. More detail of this solution will be considered later.

If  in (33) then:

(34)

Setting  leads to the differential equation:

(35)

In general, if the wave motion is confined between physical boundaries, then (35) must be solved with respect to

boundary conditions—that is must satisfy the differential equation (35) and the prescribed values of on

these boundaries. It is reasonable to suppose that only waves of a certain frequency and wavenumber can satisfy

all these constraints. For such waves the permissible values of the (characteristic) function

are called eigenvalues and the solutions corresponding to these eigenvalues are called eigenfunctions.

For simplicity we shall suppose that the fluid is unbounded (the bounded problem with at

(say) can be attempted as an exercise) and in this case it is readily seen that is a solution to (35) provided

that:

The first pair of roots represent inertial–gravity waves and the second pair represent acoustic waves. This is not

obvious, especially with the degree of complication represented in these two relationships, so it is useful to look at

extreme cases (i.e. short/long waves) to clarify the above classification.

In such dispersion relations a basic unsheared zonal flow ( ) can be included by replacing by ( ), i.e.

Doppler shifted.

3.1  Gravity Waves

In the troposphere, the inertial frequency is small compared with the Brunt–Väisälä frequency (a global

average of ). Moreover their magnitudes together with those of and satisfy the following

inequalities:

(40)

Using relation (40) and considering short waves such that , then (38) reduces to:

(41)

This is the dispersion relation for short internal gravity waves (wavelength km say). Since the waves are rel-

atively short they are not modified significantly by rotation (no �  in (41)).
(41) defines an upper limit to the frequency, i.e.  for , with a period of about 10 minutes.

Since , the propagation is primarily in the vertical , with propagation speeds of approx-

imately 10m/s.

We can substitute  back into (22)–(26) and obtain the ‘geometry'.

EXERCISE:

Show that these oscillations are transverse (particle paths parallel to wave fronts). Derive from (41) a relationship

between group velocity and phase velocity and consider its geometric interpretation.

Gravity waves act as a signal to the surrounding fluid of localised changes in potential temperature. Short gravity

waves are dispersive since their phase velocity  is a function of  and they radiate energy.

Internal gravity waves are excited by local diabatic or mechanical forcing. A particularly interesting, important,

and ubiquitous type of gravity wave is generated when there is stably stratified flow over orography. These are know

as lee waves, a stationary wave pattern over and downstream of the obstacle. Relative to the mean wind the phase

lines slope upstream; energy must be propagated upward hence the phase velocity must have a downward compo-

nent (this follows from the previous exercise). Since the waves are stationary :

.

This can be solved for (given ) to give the phase slopes. For vertical propagation , i.e.

, hence favourable lee wave conditions require suitable local combinations of mountain/hill geometry

and large-scale flow.

The importance of vertically propagating gravity waves, especially lee waves, in forecast and climate models has

attracted recent attention and their associated vertical momentum fluxes appear to be a significant factor in the dy-

namics of the large-scale circulation and of the stratosphere in particular.

As we move towards the long wave limit of (38) the influence of rotation (through ) is increasingly felt and these

long inertial gravity waves have frequencies tending towards / Their horizontal phase speeds become large, of
relevance in the design of time-integration schemes and in the problem of initialisation. The limiting case of

 represents a pure inertial wave with neither buoyancy or pressure forces important.

EXERCISE:

Substitute  back into (22)–(26).

3.2  Acoustic waves

In a similar manner we can examine (39). The inequalities in (40) are independent of the character of the oscillation

and considering short waves such that  it follows that:

(42)

Also if , then:

(43)

The structure of these short waves may be found by substituting Eq. (43) back into (22)–(26).

EXERCISE:

Show that these waves are longitudinal with negligible temperature changes.

The motion transmits pressure perturbations with a speed c, the speed of sound, for all wavelengths—i.e. the mo-

tion is nondispersive.

For long acoustic waves i.e. ,  and  it is readily deduced that:

Since , are horizontal and vertical phase speeds, respectively, we can deduce that short acoustic waves

propagate with wave fronts almost vertical and vice-versa for long waves.

4. SIMPLIFIED SOLUTIONS TO THE LINEARIZED EQUATIONS—FILTERING APPROXIMATIONS

It is useful to simplify the exact linearized equations since we can then extend the physical principles behind these

approximations to simplify the much more complicated non-linear equations.

In particular, in this section we shall show how sound waves and gravity waves can be filtered, and determine con-

ditions under which the static approximation to the pressure field is valid.

It is not obvious ‘a priori' how an approximation made in one equation feeds through to affect terms in other equa-

tions and hence modify the mathematical and physical solutions. We therefore carry out the necessary elimination

rather carefully and for this purpose we retain the parameters to trace the effects of an approxima-

tion. However, we see from (32) that and occur in the combination which vanishes in the exact

equations . Consequently, a spurious term will arise if we neglect but retain , or

vice-versa. We therefore must either retain both and or neglect both. We therefore have to set in

(32).

For reasons already discussed, the acoustic and inertial-gravity solutions to (32) are proportional to

, provided that the oscillations obey the following frequency equation:

(45)

4.1  The elimination of acoustic waves

It is helpful to discuss the physical origin of acoustic waves in order to indicate the mathematical approximations

necessary for their elimination. Acoustic waves will occur in any elastic medium, and the elastic compressibility

of a fluid is represented by in the continuity equation, so it is reasonable to suppose that the removal of

this term will filter acoustic waves. Moreover, since we want to use these simplified (anelastic) equations in, for

example, a later analysis of gravity waves, we hope that the effect of filtering sound waves will not distort the grav-

ity waves in the anelastic equations

So setting ,  in the general frequency equation (45) gives:

(46)

(46) has only two roots in , contrasting with the corresponding exact frequency equation (36) which has four

roots, representing two inertial-gravity waves and two acoustic waves. Rearranging (46) and noting that

The short-wave approximation ( ) to (47) is:

(48)

which by comparison with the short-wave approximation to the exact equation (41) clearly represents an (undis-

torted) gravity-wave oscillation. Similarly the long inertial waves represented by  are undistorted.

The basic criterion for neglect of , viz , is obtained by comparing (46) and (36) and this

criterion can be seen to be that:

That is, that the frequency of inertial-gravity waves must be much smaller than the acoustic frequency, a condition

always well satisfied.

From these considerations we can use the acoustically filtered equations with confidence in any detailed examina-

tion of gravity waves in the atmosphere.

Putting in the fully non-linear equations defines a set of equations which do not support acoustic

waves. Although local elastic density changes are absent, variations in density are included through the vertical

density variation  and where multiplied by  in the vertical momentum equation.

4.2  The hydrostatic approximation

The hydrostatic approximation to the pressure field ( ) can be made if in the ver-

tical component of the momentum equation (19). However, neither the precise circumstances under which this ap-

proximation is valid nor its dynamical feedback on wave structure is obvious.

Referring to (45) it is clear that the criteria for the neglect of the terms involving  are:

(a)

The first criterion is always well satisfied by inertial-gravity and geostrophic waves, since these are of low frequen-

cy by comparison with the acoustic oscillations. The second criterion is well satisfied by inertial waves but not by

very short gravity waves, since from (41) we established that is their approximate frequency. We therefore

examine this second criterion a little more carefully. From (41) we see that the frequency of pure gravity waves is

in which case only if . We can therefore only set for systems with flow

'geometry' satisfying this criterion, i.e. the horizontal wavelength must be much greater than the vertical

wavelength.

To demonstrate this more clearly we set ,  in (45), showing that:

(49)

Comparing this equation with (41) it is obvious that unless , the gravity wave will be consider-

ably distorted if the pressure field is hydrostatic. The inertial wave is, however, unaffected. So in particular, if the

system being analysed has comparable vertical and horizontal wavelength, the hydrostatic assumption should not

be used - for example in convective scale models. If however , that is km for disturbances of

depth  km, the hydrostatic approximation will not appreciably distort the gravity waves.

Acoustic frequencies do not appear in (49) and at first sight it would appear that all acoustic oscillations have been

filtered from the equations of motion by making the pressure fields hydrostatic. This is not the case however, since

oscillations characterised by everywhere are not represented in (49); since this equation was obtained from

(32) by assuming that was not identically zero. Vertically propagating acoustic waves ( )are, however, fil-

tered by demanding that the pressure field should by hydrostatic.

4.3  The Lamb wave

We now examine the case where everywhere. In this case (32) is clearly redundant, and we must refer back

to (29) and (31) to obtain the frequency of possible oscillations. From these equations with

static  i.e. the initial state.

The remaining oscillation is represented by:

Since trace the elastic compressibility this type of motion is a form of acoustic wave, and can be eliminated

by setting  in the continuity equation and  in the vertical momentum equation (19).

Note that, if  but , a spurious pressure perturbation  will arise.

To discuss the structure of the oscillation more carefully set , in which case:

(53)

Referring back to the equations of motion in the usual way we obtain for the rest of the variables

The oscillation is therefore a pressure pulse propagating horizontally at the speed of sound. This type of oscillation

is known as a Lamb wave; it has negligible physical significance and is removed by the anelastic approximation.

The Lamb wave can also be eliminated by appropriate upper- or lower-boundary conditions. For large-scale fore-

cast models these methods of elimination are not usually appropriate. However the longest gravity waves have

comparable phase speeds to the Lamb wave (see Section 7).

It is worth stressing that the presence of the elastic term in the continuity equation is rather concealed in the pres-

sure- and sigma-coordinate forms of the continuity equation, however both (9) and (15) are elastic (even with the

hydrostatic approximation, ).

Although the hydrostatic approximation filters vertically propagating sound waves it is unnecessarily restrictive

and it has been shown that a small approximation to the vertical acceleration can achieve the same effect (Miller,

1974; Miller and White, 1984).

4.4  Filtering of gravity waves

For the theoretical study of large-scale dynamics and also for the earlier large-scale numerical models, the presence

of gravity waves is of little significance (and a nuisance!). The following analysis demonstrates that requiring the

local rate of change of divergence to be zero is a sufficient filter.

Taking (17)–(21), setting  and eliminating  and  leads to the equations:

where we have introduced an additional tracer, , on . These equations have the

dispersion relation:

It can readily be seen that setting eliminates the inertial–gravity wave solution. Use of the rotational or

geostrophic wind clearly achieves this.

4.5  Filtered Rossby wave (previously the  solution)

Using the previous filtering approximations and now retaining the variation of Coriolis parameter with latitude

leads to the following equation for the pressure perturbation ( ):

(55)

Putting  proportional to  gives the dispersion relation:

and for a uniform basic zonal current  (i.e. replacing  by ):

(56)

Thus these waves, known as Rossby waves, must propagate westward relative to the mean zonal flow since:

Clearly Rossby waves are dispersive and long zonal and meridional wavelengths will propagate fastest. However

typical values show that large-scale Rossby waves move quite slowly (10 m s-1). From (56) we can deduce that

short zonal wavelengths have a group velocity opposite in direction to their phase velocity.

Equation (55) is a form of the barotropic vorticity equation which states that the vertical component of absolute

vorticity is conserved following the horizontal motion. A useful physical appreciation of the westward propagation

is shown in Fig. 1  (from Holton).

Figure  1. Perturbation vorticity field and induced velocity field (dashed arrows) for a meridionally displaced

chain of fluid parcels. The heavy wavy line shows the original perturbation position, and the light line shows the

westward displacement of the pattern due to advection by the induced velocity field.

By considering a chain of fluid parcels along a latitude circle and requiring that is conserved then, if

initially, a meridional displacement  results in:

but

A sinusoidal displacement therefore gives positive (cyclonic) vorticity for southward displacements and negative

(anticyclonic) vorticity for northward displacements. It is then clear from the diagram that this induced flow field

advects the chain of fluid parcels such that the wave pattern propagates westwards.

5. SURFACE GRAVITY WAVES

So far we have considered periodic oscillations in unbounded fluids, and the question of appropriate boundary con-

ditions has not arisen. We now examine waves in a region bounded below by a smooth, horizontal, rigid boundary

and above by a free surface. A “free” surface as the name implies means that the surface shape responds to the

motion within the fluid and cannot be determined ‘a priori' i.e. the fluid motion and the boundary shape must be

determined simultaneously for a complete solution of a free-boundary problem.

Any smooth surface, either free or rigid, must be a material boundary. That is, particles adjoining the surface follow

the surface contours. It follows that at , where is the surface profile, defines this (kin-

ematic) condition. So , a condition with reduces to on a horizontal, rigid boundary. How-

ever, this kinematic condition alone is not sufficient to determine the shape of a free surface, and an additional

(dynamical) boundary condition must be specified to determine a solution. This extra boundary condition is con-

tinuity of pressure. In practice this condition has to be re-expressed in terms of kinematic quantities by using either

the momentum or Bernoulli equations.

We will consider the simplest example of surface gravity waves and isolate their physical origin. For this purpose

we suppose the fluid to be unstratified . Acoustic waves can be eliminated for reasons given earlier, but

this has to be done rather carefully so we retain  at present.

For simplicity we will look at the behaviour of small amplitude waves in a fluid with a free surface

above which the pressure is assumed constant (e.g. air–sea interface, model of waves

on inversion). The lower boundary is assumed to be a rigid horizontal surface at .

With the above comments in mind the (non linear) boundary conditions are:

(i)  at

(ii)  at

(iii) pressure continuous at the free surface, which in this example is equivalent to at

.

The linearized forms of these conditions are:

(i)  at

(ii)  at

(iii) at which, by using (29) and the condition that ,

can be shown to be equivalent to

(58)

From (58) we see that if we eliminate acoustic waves by setting , we must also set in the

boundary condition otherwise an oscillation, spurious in the sense that it cannot occur in the exact equations, will

arise through an inconsistent approximation.

Equation (57), with the above boundary conditions, can readily be solved for all wavelengths but it is

instructive to consider long and short waves independently.

5.1  Long waves

If waves are long to the extent that and , then the non-hydrostatic term containing the term in

If the height scale is negligible by comparison with the density scale height left( )

and is, therefore, the propagation speed of long surface waves in a liquid or an atmospheric layer which is much

shallower than 7 km. For instance, long waves on the boundary-layer inversion,  km and so  m s-1.

If, on the other hand,  (for example in a deep gas) then .

It is easy to show that the earths rotation only becomes important for synoptic scales or longer. For the earths at-

mosphere these deep long waves propagate at about 270 m s-1. These long waves are often referred to as “shallow

water” waves and the equation set resulting from (17)–(21) with the relevant approximations (normally with

) form the “shallow water equations”. These provide a popular equation set for analytical/dynamical

studies and also for testing and designing numerical integration schemes.

5.2  Short waves

When and the term involving cannot be neglected whereas rotation can obviously be so. The

solution can be shown to be:

where . Hence for , , a much slower phase speed than the long waves.

If desired, free-surface waves can be eliminated by imposing rigid upper and lower boundary conditions.

6. EQUATORIAL WAVES

Near the Equator atmospheric waves acquire a rather different character and what were clearly distinct mechanisms

cease to be so. Following Matsuno (1966) we will study equatorial waves using the shallow water equations with

, known as the equatorial beta-plane, and including , and linearize again about a state of no mo-

tion.  Hence:

Obviously are a pair of eastward and westward propagating inertial gravity waves while is a westward

propagating Rossby wave.

For  these three solutions are distinct but for , (65) can be factorized:

The root is unacceptable (show) but the root is an eastward propagating in-

ertial gravity wave and the root omega is called a mixed Rossby gravity wave; this is

because, as (the limiting case of gravity waves (see (66)), while, as , the limit-

ing case of Rossby waves (see (67)).

One other important special case is when . This corresponds to a wave with identically zero. This has

solutions (see (61)) , where only the positive root is acceptable (the negative root violates

the equatorial beta-plane assumption. See also (65) with ). This fast-moving eastward propagating wave

is the Kelvin wave (see Fig. 2 ). These waves occur commonly in the ocean as waves along coastlines (decaying

exponentially away from the coast).

gravity waves. Considerable recent interest has been shown in these tropical waves in studies of diabatic forcing in

Figure  4. Waves in a compressible atmosphere (from J. S. A. Green — Dynamics lecture notes)

Fig. 4 summarises the basic wave types. It is a dispersion diagram of horizontal phase speed plotted against hori-

zontal wavelength (both logarithmic scales) so isopleths of wave period are straight lines of unit slope with inter-

cept . Some points of interest are:

(i) The short vertical wavelength acoustic waves which, while having phase speeds normal to their

wave fronts equal to , have very large horizontal phase speeds (with wave fronts almost

parallel to the ground).

(ii) Mesoscale gravity waves are almost non-dispersive.

(iii) Rossby waves for long wavelengths vary like while the shorter wavelengths include the mixed

Rossby-gravity mode.

In previous sections we have identified several wave types with a wide range of frequencies. The choice of time

step in a numerical model is dominated by the highest frequency waves (see Lecture Note 1.4). Thus for example,

acoustic waves have a frequency and for a typical large-scale model .

Hence is dominated by the vertically propagating acoustic waves and it is desirable to filter out these verti-

cally propagating waves by assuming hydrostatic balance.

Horizontally propagating acoustic waves (Lamb) pose less of a problem since their frequencies are not much higher

than the long gravity waves discussed earlier left ( ). Nevertheless various numerical

techniques have been devised to ease this restriction (see Lecture Note 1.4).

We could make the anelastic approximation ( in the continuity equation) but retain the non-hydrostat-

ic terms. An equation set based on (17)–(21) with then allows us to predict , and ; however

these components must satisfy the continuity equation. Differentiating (20) with respect to time and substituting

from (17), (18) and (19) gives a diagnostic Poisson-type equation for the pressure of the form

which must be inverted each time step. This is a relatively expensive procedure

and not justifiable for large-scale models because the hydrostatic approximation is well-satisfied. For much smaller

scale models where the decision is no longer straightforward and generally either the anelastic approxi-

mation is made or sound waves are retained and treated by some sophisticated numerical technique.
