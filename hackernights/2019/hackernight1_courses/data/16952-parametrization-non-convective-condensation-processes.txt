2. CLOUD PHYSICAL PROCESSES

As was done for the thermodynamics, a short summary of the principles of cloud physics shall be given here.

There are essentially two kinds of process associated with clouds that must be considered in numerical models: the

formation of clouds and the release of precipitation. The formation of clouds is due to condensation processes, i.e.

a change of phase from water vapour to water droplets or to ice crystals and vice versa. Precipitation, on the other

hand, is released by transformation of small cloud droplets into larger rain drops Fig. 2 .

2.1  Condensation of water vapour

We consider here the chemical equilibrium of liquid water and of water vapour. Measurements show that, for the

case of pure liquid water and of pure water vapour, the equilibrium saturation vapour pressure over convex surfaces

is higher than over plane surfaces according to

(14)

where is the saturation vapour pressure of a droplet of radius , and is the saturation vapour pressure over

a plane surface. The fraction  increases with decreasing droplet radius, as shown in Table 1.

Thus a pure droplet of radius needs 12.8% supersaturation in order to be in equilibrium with the sur-

rounding water vapour. Since newly formed droplets are necessarily very small, large amounts of supersaturation

are needed to start the condensation of water vapour in pure air.

In the atmosphere, however, relative humidities above 101% are rarely observed. The reason is that various kinds

of small particles that serve as condensation nuclei are always present in the atmosphere. Due to the hygroscopic

effect of these particles, a smaller equilibrium vapour pressure is needed for the very small droplets. We can, there-

fore, always assume that condensation takes place whenever the relative humidity exceeds 100%.

The droplets generated by condensation processes are very small. The size spectrum of cloud droplets in the pres-

ence of condensation nuclei ranges from 0.1 um to 10 pum. Fig. 3 shows droplet spectra of various kinds of clouds.

As can be seen, non-precipitating clouds as Sc and Cu have a rather narrow distribution. This distribution can be

explained by droplet growth due to condensation, which is large for the smallest droplets and decreases for the larg-

er droplets, thus leading to a narrow spectrum.

2.2  Release of precipitation

The water droplets formed by condensation of water vapour are very small compared to raindrops in drizzle and in

rain, which have a size of 50–100 and 1000 , respectively. Therefore, processes other than condensation

must be present to form rain drops. The two processes that are believed to be the most efficient in producing rain

drops are coalescence and the Bergeron process.

Coalescence occurs when water droplets are moving with different fall speeds due to their different sizes. By col-
lision and fusion the larger droplets increase in size. The growth rate of a collector droplet may be prescribed as

(15)

where is the droplet diameter, is the fall velocity of the collector relative to the small droplets, is the

density of the droplet and is the cloud water content. is the efficiency of collection. The efficiency of coales-

cence depends on the size spectra of the droplets and is more efficient for a broader spectrum. Coalescence becomes

efficient only if droplets with radii larger than 10 are present. Coalescence results in a significant broadening

of the spectrum of the cloud droplets. However, large rain drops are produced only in clouds of large vertical extents

(depths of several km) which enables falling drops to collect enough small droplets. The coalescence process can,

therefore, release precipitation in deep water clouds. This precipitation process is important in low latitudes, where

deep clouds of high water content are present, but it is not very efficient at higher latitudes.

Bergeron Process. The most efficient process of precipitation at higher latitudes is associated with the formation
of ice particles at temperatures below about . Generally, ice particles form by freezing of supercooled water

droplets on various freezing nuclei. Freezing nuclei play a similar role to that of condensation nuclei for the con-

densation process. They initiate freezing at temperatures of around . Ice particles that are already formed

grow very fast by collecting supercooled droplets because the equilibrium vapour pressure over ice is lower than

over water (see Fig. 1 ). The possibility that precipitation is initiated by the formation of ice crystals at low temper-

atures was first mentioned by Bergeron (1935).

Spectra of rain drops. Spectra of rain-drop sizes observed in the atmosphere are often described analytically. An
analytical distribution that is often referred to is that derived by Marshall and Palmer (1948) from observational

data

where  is the number of raindrops per unit volume of air, and  and  are empirical parameters.

3. PARAMETRIZATION OF NON-CONVECTIVE CONDENSATION AND PRECIPITATION PROCESS-
ES IN NUMERICAL MODELS

In this paragraph we consider clouds associated with the large-scale flow as resolved in numerical models. Typical

examples of this cloud type are the clouds associated with fronts. As for other processes, condensation processes

and precipitation processes can only be parametrized by means of the large-scale variables given at the model's grid

points, which are available at very coarse resolution of, say, about 100 km in the horizontal and 1 km in the vertical,

and in time intervals of 10 min. The most important parameters are humidity, temperature and vertical motion. The

vertical velocity determines the condensation rate and, therefore, the supply of liquid water content. Temperature

also controls the liquid water content, because the maximum amount of vapour is a function of temperature. The

temperature distribution in a cloud is also important for the type of precipitation—rain or snow—as mentioned be-

fore.

The parametrization of cloud processes must be kept very simple, since the numerical integrations must be carried

out in a reasonable time. Two simple parametrization schemes that are used in numerical models are described here.

In the first scheme, only condensation of water vapour is considered while clouds are not parametrized. This

scheme is frequently used in numerical models. In the second scheme, the cloud water is predicted and the release

of precipitation is parametrized in a simple way.

3.1  Scheme without cloud stage

In this scheme the cloud stage is skipped and it is, therefore, assumed that all the condensed water vapour is imme-

diately converted into precipitation. This scheme is easily implemented in a numerical model. We consider the

model equations for the large-scale values of temperature and moisture which, in the case of a grid-point model,

prescribe the time changes of the temperature  and specif humidity  at the grid points.

(16)

The terms and include all the adiabatic and diabatic processes, except for the condensation of water

vapour. The condensation rate  is the rate at which the saturation mixing ratio  changes in saturated air.

In numerical models the condensation rate is generally determined diagnostically. Therefore, preliminary values

 and  are first predicted by neglecting the effects of condensation

(17)

If the air is found to be supersaturated

and are adjusted to their saturation values, which are then the final values and at time step

(18)

?These corrections follow from

where the saturation value  is that for the corrected temperature which is approximated as

The condensation rate  is therefore given as

As the assumption is made that all the condensated water vapour immediately falls out as rain, the precipitation

rate is (units : )

3.2  A cloud parameterization scheme

Most numerical models consider the condensation processes as described before. The cloud phase is skipped by

assuming that the condensed water vapour falls immediately out as precipitation. Although the release of latent heat

seems the most important process for the large-scale flow, the formation of clouds and the release of precipitation

may also be important as they are a part of the hydrological cycle. Consequently there have been several attempts

to parametrize clouds and precipitation processes, notable schemes are those by Kessler (1969) and Ogura and

Takahashi (1971). Kessler's scheme is designed for warm clouds, since it considers the release of precipitation to

be mainly due to coalescence, whereas Ogura and Takehashi designed their scheme for cumulus clouds. The

scheme described here takes into account the two main processes important for the release of precipitation—coa-

lescence and the Bergeron process. This scheme has recently been proposed by Okland while staying at the EC-

MWF. The advantage of this scheme it that it is rather inexpensive for computer calculations and that it takes the

main precipitation processes into account. As the scheme considers cloud water as a further variable, the prognostic

equations are, therefore

and are the mixing ratios for water vapour and cloud water, respectively. and are the evaporation

rates of cloud water and rain water and is the rate of release of precipitation due to conversion from cloud

water to rain water.

The parametrization of condensation is done in the same way as described before, and the evaporation of cloud

water  due to increase of the saturation mixing ratio is similarly calculated.

The release of precipitation is parametrized as follows. Two types of precipitating clouds are considered.

(a) Clouds with low temperatures at cloud top: with . For this cloud type it

is assumed that the total liquid cloud water is immediately released as precipitation.

(b) Clouds with temperatures at top above : but with a high cloud water content

, with , where

It is further assumed that cloud water in excess of this critical value is instantaneously removed as precipitation.

Besides the condensation processes and precipitation processes, the following processes are also considered:

(a) Evaporation of rain

(b) Collection of cloud water in non precipitating cloud layers by precipitation from above l

These processes are parameterized follows Kessler (1969).
