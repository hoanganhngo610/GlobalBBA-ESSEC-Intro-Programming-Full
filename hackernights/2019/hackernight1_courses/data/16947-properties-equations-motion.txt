Properties of the equations of motion

By Mike Cullen

European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

Abstract

Some generic properties of the nonlinear equations of fluid flow are demonstrated with simple illustrative problems. Properties
of the shallow water model are then described, and the solutions shown to be close to that of a ‘balanced’ approximation to
them.

In three dimensions, the generalisation of the concept of ‘balance’ leads to models from which sound waves have been filtered,
in particular the incompressible and anelastic models. Properties of their solutions are described. In particular, analytic
solution of the equations requires solution of an elliptic problem, which thus also has to be solved in numerical models using
the equations. The hydrostatic equations can be solved without solving an elliptic problem, but it is shown that this means that
the solutions break down for weak stratification. Use of the hydrostatic approximation in numerical models requires use of a
numerical equivalent of a non-hydrostatic pressure to ensure stability.

Operational models are more correctly viewed as solving space-time averages of the equations. Both Eulerian and Lagrangian
averaging procedures are illustrated. In particular, both suggest that the averaged variable representing the fluid trajectory is
best treated as different from that representing the momentum.

Averaged equations can be related to filtered models in which all inertia-gravity waves are removed. While such models do not
give a complete description of the atmosphere, since they exclude real waves, they can describe the motions that are well-
resolved and predictable by operational models. Their properties are thus useful in designing models, particularly the way that
the computation of the resolved flow is related to the sub-grid models which parametrise the unresolved motions.

1. INTRODUCTION

In operational weather forecast and climate models we have to solve the equations of fluid motion and thermody-

namics, subject to boundary conditions at the Earth’s surface and prescribed external forcing due to radiation.

While the basic laws governing dynamics and thermodynamics are well-known, and the laws governing phase

changes between water vapour, liquid water, and ice are well established, many compromises have to be made in

applying these laws in an operational model. The current operational version of the ECMWF model has a resolution

of about 40km in the horizontal and 60 levels in the vertical. Real processes occur on scales down to millimetres

or less, and regions of the atmosphere where small scale processes are important are often highly concentrated, for

instance in convective updraughts. Thus a coarse scale average of the flow may be quite misleading, an average of

a localised updraught looks like a smooth wave.

These lectures concentrate on representing the equations of motion and thermodynamics. Observations show that,

qualitatively, the atmosphere behaves in a similar way all the time. Weather systems move around, and the overall

level of activity varies with the season. A model has to represent the evolution of individual weather systems accu-

rately, and also to maintain the statistical ‘steady state’ which ensures that it always represents a possible state of

the atmosphere after the limits of deterministic predictability are passed.

No model can be accurate in all respects, and compromises are necessary. In these lectures, we identify the prop-

erties of the equations which control the long-term behaviour of the solutions. These will be important aspects to

treat accurately in numerical models.

2. OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR

The most useful way to gain information about the solutions of the equations of motion and thermodynamics is to

study observations of the atmosphere. Satellite pictures show large scale cloud patterns, Figure 1, which on closer

examination contain more and more fine-scale detail, Figure 2. Thus, as numerical models reach higher and higher

resolution, new phenomena will appear all the time. There will also always be features that are not well resolved,

and thus represented inaccurately. It may well be beneficial to exclude them from the model until they can be treat-

ed accurately. Thus the fundamental problem is to maintain accurate treatment of well-resolved features, while ex-

cluding those not treated accurately and representing their bulk effect by a parametrisation.

phenomena. However, observations show clearly that this is not the case. Figure 3 is a classical set of observations

from commercial aircraft, due to Gage and Nastrom (1986, Fig.2). The energy spectrum is essentially a continuous

function of horizontal scale, there is no ‘spectral gap’ which would make modelling easier. The situation is sum-

marised in Figure 4, due to Smagorinsky (1974), which shows typical space and time scales of atmospheric phe-

nomena. Whatever resolution is chosen will cut across the active scales of some phenomena, resulting in inaccurate

treatment.

groups of flight segments. The meridional wind spectra are shifted one decade to the right and the potential

temperature spectra two decades. From Gage and Nastrom (1986, Fig.2)

Observations also demonstrate that the equations have very non-smooth solutions. Figure 5 is a balloon observation

of Brunt-Vaisala frequency, essentially static stability, which shows very large variations on the smallest scale re-

solvable by the balloon. This illustrates that differentiated quantities, in particular, will not be robust diagnostics of

atmospheric behaviour, and not be safe quantities to use in a numerical model. Another difficulty is that the small

scale variations are not universal, so cannot be regarded as homogeneous turbulence in spectral space. Figure 6 is

an example of the wind trace from an anemometer. There are intense fast fluctuations all the time, much larger when

the wind is stronger. Superposed on these are larger scale changes. Ideally, we would wish to predict the larger scale

changes, together with a measure of the amplitude of the small-scale fluctuations. We would not expect, or need,

to predict the small scale fluctuations deterministically.

We can see from Figure 1 and Figure 2 that there is coherent large scale organisation in the flow, such as the cloud

band with waves extending SW to NE across the Atlantic. There is also a region of regular cellular convection south

of Iceland, and, in Figure 2, a regular gravity wave-train extending across Ireland and Scotland. It is well-known

that many different types of organisation are possible, depending on the atmospheric state and the space and time-

scales examined.

systems. A sequence of weather maps, such as Figure 7, shows that these evolve in an irregular non-periodic way,

but that statistically they are in steady state. Qualitatively, weather maps look similar from day to day. The general

level of activity only varies with season, which is on a much longer time-scale than that of the individual systems.

3. TOY PROBLEMS

3.1  Introductory remarks

Very elementary models of real phenomena are often linear, so that they can be solved analytically. The solutions

can be used to validate numerical calculations. Such tests were used to establish the basic rules which numerical

methods have to obey to approximate solutions over large time periods. Essentially a scheme which is consistent

with the analytic equation will converge to the solution provided that it is stable (Richtmyer and Morton, 1967,

p.45). However, realistic models have to be nonlinear, and cannot be solved analytically except in special cases.

Thus numerical methods have to be used, and tend to be assumed correct if the solutions are correct in the special

cases where analytic solution is possible, and do not ‘blow up’ for general data. However, the proof that the numer-

ical methods are giving the correct answer requires knowledge that the original equation has solutions, and even

then it may be very difficult to prove that a numerical method is stable. In particular, saying that a method has th

order accuracy requires the assumption that the solution has continuous derivatives, allowing the Taylor ex-

pansion to be constructed. Spectral methods can only converge to solutions with infinitely many derivatives.

Equations which correctly describe real fluid flows must have solutions, since fluid properties do not diverge to in-

finity. We can thus expect the compressible Navier-Stokes equations to be soluble (though this has not yet been

proved), since they are a very well validated model of real fluids. However, problems start when simplifying as-

sumptions are made. For instance, there is no such thing as an inviscid fluid, but real viscosity in the atmosphere

acts on scales less than millimetres except in the very high atmosphere. Thus it is negligible on practical modelling

scales, and it is natural to neglect the viscosity, giving the Euler equations. However, it is not at all clear that the

Euler equations have solutions. It may well be that any real flow generates small enough scales for viscosity to be

important, and thus equations which omit it will ‘blow up’. This will lead to a loss of predictability, as defined by

Lorenz (1969), since the solution will depend critically on unresolvable processes. The distinction is easiest to

make at rigid boundaries. The Navier-Stokes equations will be solved with a no-slip boundary condition. However,

the only boundary condition that can be set for the Euler equations is one of no normal flow, with free slip allowed

along the boundary. In practice, there will always be a thin boundary layer where viscosity is important. It is there-

fore very dangerous to make deductions from the inviscid equations.

Another example is the use of the hydrostatic approximation. This is accurate enough for numerical models with

resolution less than about 10km, and is often used at higher resolutions. However, we will see that it is very unlikely

that these equations have solutions. When areas of weak stratification develop, we will show that the non-hydro-

static pressure is critical. Thus results deduced from hydrostatic equations will always be suspect.

We now illustrate these issues with some very simple problems which contain elements found in the general fluid

equations.

with  at . The solution is

which blows up at . This example illustrates the generic tendency of the solutions of nonlinear equations to

collapse to singularities, as is believed to happen with vorticity in three-dimensional incompressible flow.

The second example is the one-dimensional Burger’s equation

(3)

This is written in, successively

(i) Lagrangian form

(ii) Eulerian advective form

(iii) Eulerian flux form

Equation (3) can be solved by direct integration by characteristics, giving

(4)

Given periodic boundary conditions, and non-constant initial data, the solution always becomes multivalued as il-

lustrated in Fig. 8

This is because, given , the solution has values both and

at .

Once the solution becomes multivalued, the derivatives with respect to in eq. (3) cannot be calculated. However,

the Lagrangian equation still makes sense, as it simply states that particles move at a constant speed. In order to

determine how to continue the solution, it is necessary to return to the physics of the problem from which the equa-

tion was derived. There are then three options:

(i) Say that the equation breaks down, and do not attempt to continue the solution.

(ii) If the equation was derived from the physics of particles, and there is no reason why particles

should not overtake each other, accept the solution of the Lagrangian form of eq. (3) and abandon

the Eulerian forms. We will see that this is a very useful interpretation in two- and three-

dimensional fluid mechanics. It is not natural for a genuinely one-dimensional problem.

(iii) Use the Eulerian flux form, interpreted as defining momentum balance when integrated over a finite

interval in . Thus we have

Then, after the solution first becomes multivalued, the solution can be continued as a discontinuity propagating at

a speed

(6)

Suffices L and R refer to values to left and right of the discontinuity. This solution can be proved to be the limit of

that of a viscous version of the equation as the viscosity tends to zero. Thus if the original physical problem was a

slightly viscous flow, the inviscid equation can be solved with a discontinuity, and all large scale aspects of the flow

predicted without knowledge of the viscous sub-layer. Under these conditions deterministic predictability is main-

tained. This situation occurs in three-dimensional supersonic flow, but is not typical of subsonic flow.

The numerical method to be used also depends on the physical interpretation of the problem. In case (ii), semi-

Lagrangian methods will be accurate and Eulerian methods will not be useable. In case (iii), only Eulerian flux

form methods will give the correct solution. Furthermore, since the solution is discontinuous, the numerical method

cannot be more than first order accurate, as a step discontinuity cannot be approximated to more than first order by

a smooth function. The skill comes in blending methods which are first order accurate at discontinuities with ones

which are of higher order accuracy elsewhere.

While this example suggests that advection always produces discontinuities, this is an artefact of the one-dimen-

sional geometry. The next example shows that in two dimensions it is possible to maintain smoothness.

3.3  Two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations

These equations, for a uniformly rotating fluid, can be written

(7)

Here, are velocity components, is the pressure and the Coriolis parameter. We can write eq. (7) in vorti-

city form as

(8)

Typical boundary conditions would be that  on the boundary of a closed domain .

Given smooth initial data, it can be proved that there is a unique solution which stays smooth for infinite time.

Therefore it can be approximated by stable numerical methods of arbitrarily high orders of accuracy, in particular

spectral methods. It is important to understand why the result is true, because this will determine what properties

a numerical method will have to satisfy if it is to be nonlinearly stable and accurate over long periods of integration.

A detailed account of the proof, with references, is set out in Gerard (1992). A more extensive text on the subject

is Lions (1996). The basic reason that it is possible is because the vorticity is conserved by advection, so any solu-

tion must be a rearrangement of the initial data. The key step is to write the velocity in terms of the vorticity using

the Biot-Savart integral:

(9)

is the term from the boundary conditions. This allows the velocity gradients to be estimated in terms of the vor-

ticity gradients by

Combining this with (10) gives an estimate of the form

(12)

where grows exponentially in time. This growth is the symptom of the characteristic enstrophy cascade of two-

dimensional turbulence (Leith 1983) and is associated with an inverse cascade of kinetic energy, and hence stream-

function, to large scales. This has been illustrated in many computations, e.g. Farge and Sadourny (1989)

There are two main implications of this proof for numerical methods. Firstly, the values of the vorticity must not

be changed by advection. This favours the use of quasi-monotone schemes. Secondly, the rate of growth of the vor-

ticity gradients must be restricted to the analytic value while they are well-resolved. This is aided in Eulerian

schemes by the use of energy and enstrophy-conserving schemes, which control the mean scale of the flow (Ar-

akawa, 1966), and in semi-Lagrangian schemes by using area-preserving trajectory mappings. The latter are an ac-

tive research area, see for instance Leslie and Purser (1995). Since the exact solution generates arbitrarily small

scales in parts of the flow, a dissipation mechanism is required to remove enstrophy at the smallest scales, even

though the analytic solution is actually smooth without requiring viscosity.

4. SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS

4.1  Basic properties

These equations are normally written as

(13)

is the depth of the fluid, typically chosen to have only small perturbations about a mean value . If these equa-

tions are derived as the vertical mean of the flow of an isentropic atmosphere with a free upper boundary, has to

be replaced by in the pressure gradient term. If they are derived as the vertical mean of the flow

of an isentropic atmosphere between rigid upper and lower boundaries, must be replaced by in the pres-

sure gradient term. The equations can also be applied to a single layer with different density from the rest of the

fluid. In this case g becomes a ‘reduced’ gravity, and it is likely that can be of the same size as , and even

become zero over part of the domain (as in outcropping density layers in the ocean), see Figure 9.

If we linearise the equations about a state of rest, and assume solutions proportional to , we find so-

lutions . The propagating solutions are inertio-gravity waves, with speed

(14)

They are pure gravity waves if and pure inertial waves if . In the general nonlinear case, the solution

corresponding to the zero value of  becomes potential vorticity advection.

The nature of the solutions in any specific case depends on the Froude number defined by ,

where is a velocity scale; the Rossby number , where is a horizontal length scale, and the Rossby

radius . If is such that , then the gravity waves are fast compared with the advection

speed, irrespective of horizontal scale. If the inertio-gravity waves are fast compared with advection

speeds, but this condition is only satisfied on large scales (much larger than 100km for U=10 ms-1).

The equations conserve the energy integral

(15)

 and the potential vorticity  following fluid particles, where .

The inertio-gravity waves will always break after a time of order , where is a typical flow speed. When

they break, momentum balance is preserved while energy is dissipated. Accurate numerical solution requires Eul-

erian flux form schemes which conserve momentum. The equations conserve the potential vorticity in a Lagrangian

sense, until the waves break. Conservation is then lost.

If  and  is a mean value of , then Rossby waves can propagate. Their frequency is

where are horizontal wavenumbers. The wave speed thus increases with wavelength. On large horizontal

scales the last term of the denominator dominates, and the wave speed becomes independent of wavelength.

4.2  Properties of ‘slow’ solutions

If  is constant, the solution of the linearised equations corresponding to  satisfies

(17)

Thus the velocity is geostrophic and non-divergent. In cases where is small, we can thus approximate equa-

tions (13) by the quasi-geostrophic equations, which can be written

(18)

where the suffix g represents advection by the geostrophic wind and is the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity.

Bourgeois and Beale (1994) proved that there is a solution of the shallow water equations (13) close to the solution

of (18) if is small. In order to study the behaviour of (18), we consider two limiting cases. If

then we can approximate in (18) by . The evolution equation is then exactly equation (7) for two-

dimensional incompressible flow with a streamfunction . The properties of (18) are thus determined

by vorticity conservation. If , then (18) can be approximated by

(19)

This is called the ‘equivalent barotropic’ model. The advection term in the second equation is small because

is only a small part of the potential vorticity. The advection of the larger part is identically zero.

Thus we expect the dynamics in this regime to be much less active.

We illustrate these two cases by computations with a shallow water model on a sphere with a grid of 288x193

points. The value of is taken as uniform, so that the two limiting regimes can be reproduced by

taking different values of , referred to as ‘deep’ and ‘shallow’. The model used a semi-Lagrangian, semi-implicit

scheme with as variables, so no conservation properties were exactly enforced. the initial data has wave-

numbers between 3 and 19. The deformation radius corresponds to wavenumber 3 in the ‘deep’ case and wav-

enumber 13 in the ‘shallow’ case. Thus the regimes computed both have fairly close to . The diagnostics

illustrated are the potential and kinetic energies, the velocity gradient norm , the po-

tential enstrophy  and the potential enstrophy gradient norm . The result for the

‘deep’ case is shown in Figure 10.

Figure  10. Diagnostics from shallow water integration with .

The results show almost exact conservation of potential enstrophy, indicating that the numerical methods, which

do not use potential vorticity as a variable, are not introducing damping. They show near conservation of the kinetic

energy (16% loss in 20 days) and potential energy. Since geostrophic balance is quite accurate on the scales mod-

elled, the kinetic energy density is essentially and the potential energy is . Thus individual

conservation of kinetic and potential energy indicates that the mean scale of the height field will be conserved. The

velocity gradient norm decreases by 58% over 20 days, showing that enstrophy conservation is not sufficient to

control all the velocity gradients. The enstrophy gradient norm increases rapidly over the first two days. After this

time, the computations cannot resolve the filamentation of the potential vorticity field. Contour dynamics methods,

Dritschel and Ambaum (1997), have to be used to follow the evolution further.

The behaviour of these computations is exactly that expected from the theory of two-dimensional incompressible

flow except for the lack of an inverse cascade of energy to large scales. This is because the rate of change of poten-

tial energy is given by

(20)

and this vanishes for non-divergent flow if there is no flow across the boundaries. The divergence is very small in

shallow water integrations with small, so the kinetic energy will be almost conserved and the mean scale of

the height field conserved. In pure two-dimensional turbulence as described by (7), there is no potential energy; so

this constraint does not operate. The inverse cascade can only operate in shallow water flow with so that

the geostrophic constraint does not operate.

Figure  11. Diagnostics from shallow water integration with .

Figure 11 illustrates the behaviour of the shallow water equations with . As expected from equation (19),

the effects of advection are weakened and the rate of increase of the enstrophy gradient norm is much less. Thus

there is no longer a strong cascade of enstrophy to small scales. The potential vorticity distribution now looks much

like the height distribution, as shown in (19). Both change only very slowly in time. The kinetic energy decrease is

12%, so the mean scale of the height field hardly changes.

These results illustrate the importance of the deformation radius in determining the behaviour of ‘slow’ solu-

tions of the shallow water equations with . On scales smaller than , the dynamics is essentially vortex

dynamics. On scales larger than , the solutions are almost stationary. Further details of these computations are

given in Cullen (2002). More detailed study of these issues is given by Farge and Sadourny (1989) and Larichev

and McWilliams (1991). It should also be noted that the ‘slow’ solutions of the shallow water equations can be

approximated much more accurately than by the quasi-geostrophic equations. However, the qualitative distinction

between flows with  greater than or less than  remains.

This system of equations has 5 independent evolution equations. Two of these are sound waves, with speed

, two are inertio-gravity waves, and one has the time-scale of the advecting velocity. The inertio-

gravity wave frequency is approximately

where is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency , are horizontal wavenumbers, and is a vertical scale. Fig-

ure 4 shows that there is a large scale separation between sound waves and meteorologically significant motions,

which tend to have the advective time-scale. There is also a large scale separation between the viscous dissipation

scales and meteorological motions. However, there is not much scale separation between inertio-gravity waves and

meteorological motions.

In all circumstances relevant to weather forecasting we have , so that it is appropriate to study equations

from which sound waves have been filtered. Since viscous effects are also well-separated in general, we initially

study inviscid equations. However, viscosity is always important near rigid boundaries. It is also likely that the local

generation of small scales will make viscosity important in the interior of the atmosphere on occasions. We will

see how this possibility appears naturally in the analysis of the inviscid system.

The simplest method of filtering is to impose incompressibility, as in the two-dimensional case. If viscosity is also

omitted, this gives

However, they are not accurate in the presence of the large basic state vertical density gradient of the atmosphere,

as is a large term. Useful equations with the same mathematical structure as the incompressible equations

are obtained by making, instead, the anelastic approximation Lipps and Hemler (1982), which replaces (23) by:

(25)

where are prescribed time-independent functions satisfying the equation of

state: and the hydrostatic equation . Primes indicate pertur-

bations from the reference profiles. Eq. (24) becomes

(26)

These equations are ‘balanced’ in the sense that the pressure is determined implicitly from the velocity field. There

is a conserved potential vorticity . However, unlike the two-dimensional case, there are still 3

independent evolution equations left. The equations are thus not ‘balanced’ in the sense of Hoskins et al. (1985),

because the potential vorticity alone does not determine all the other variables. In particular, internal gravity and

inertial waves are supported.

The limitation can be avoided in numerical models by using a semi-implicit approximation to the com-

pressible equations, as used in the UK Met Office ‘new dynamics’, Cullen et al. (1997). This effectively eliminates

the sound waves. However, there is still a difficulty in representing the true upper boundary condition. The best

method is a current research topic. Inappropriate choices may re-introduce the condition , which would not

be acceptable in global models, though adequate for local mesoscale models.

We will see in section 6 that three-dimensional equations which can be described in terms of the evolution of a

single scalar can be derived by assuming that typical frequencies are slow compared with the inertial frequency, so

the Rossby number is small, or that the internal Froude number , where is a height scale,

is small. While typical values of these ratios for weather systems are about 0.1, there are significant regions where

they are O(1) or greater. Thus any system of equations based on potential vorticity alone will not be very accurate,

as Figure 4 suggests.

5.2  Solution of the inviscid incompressible equations

The results which were proved by the vorticity method of 4.2 no longer hold, since vorticity is not conserved. We

therefore use an alternative method which is based on approximating (25) by a semi-Lagrangian, semi-implicit

scheme as used in the ECMWF and many other models, and proving that the sequence of approximations converg-

es. For simplicity, we describe the method for the special case where are independent of .

A similar method can be used for the general case, but is more complicated to explain.

We assume that (25) is to be solved over a finite time interval . We will divide this interval into time-steps,

and prove convergence as . In order to construct an approximation to the solution over a single step , we

initially ignore the pressure gradient terms in (25) and integrate by characteristics. With constant, this gives a first

guess solution for the positions  of particles initially at :

The ‘polar factorisation’ theorem of Alexandrov, see Pogorelov (1973, p.475), and Brenier (1991) proves that this

construction is always possible under appropriate conditions. It is equivalent to solving a Monge-Ampere equation

(a nonlinear elliptic problem) for the trajectories. The right-hand side of the Monge-Ampere equation will be

smooth if the velocity gradients are bounded. The result is a measure-preserving mapping

which satisfies the boundary conditions.

If this argument is used in the two-dimensional case, the bound on the velocity gradients follows from (12). Caf-

farelli (1996) has proved in two-dimensions that, under suitable conditions, the solution of the Monge Ampere

equation is smooth for a smooth right-hand side. It is then possible to prove that . It

should then be possible to break any finite time interval into intervals of length , and construct a se-

quence of measure-preserving mappings . Provided that

, the velocity will evolve continuously in time as and the discrete sequence

of mappings will converge to a measure-preserving mapping satisfying (25). Thus the results obtained by the vor-

ticity argument in 3.3 should be reproduced.

In three dimensions, the necessary bound on the velocity gradients cannot be proved, and it is possible that they

increase according to the equation

(30)

As we saw in 3.2, this has infinite solutions in finite time. At present it is a major research question as to whether

singularities can be generated from smooth initial data in three-dimensional incompressible or anelastic flows. The

majority opinion is that they can. If so, it may still be possible to follow this construction provided that we can

prove . However, the limit solution may involve particles losing their identity and

‘mixing’, thus implying the effect of a small but finite viscosity.

A numerical model that follows this procedure at finite resolution can be expected to be stable and converge as res-

olution increases. The key properties that must be satisfied are the accurate solution along trajectories, in particular

the use of quasi-monotone schemes to ensure that new values cannot be generated by advection; and the implicit

modification of the trajectories to enforce the continuity equation and boundary conditions. The possible mixing

of trajectories as the resolution increases will be automatically handled by the need to average all quantities to grid-

points, so no extra viscosity should be required. The requirement that the mapping from time-step to time-step is

measure preserving is just as appropriate for a model solving (25) averaged over a finite region as for the exact

solution. The difference from the vorticity method of section 3.3 is that the monotonicity requirement now applies

to the velocity components, rather than the vorticity.

Note that, if the solutions are not smooth, and particularly if mixing of trajectories occurs, derivatives of the veloc-

ity field will become meaningless. However, quantities such as vorticity and divergence may still be meaningful in

a volume-integrated sense. Thus Kelvin’s circulation theorem and local mass balance relations would still hold.

However, the presence of singularities would prevent any proof that solutions were unique, so there will be a fun-

damental loss of predictability in the sense of Lorenz (1969). Any results deduced by manipulating or differentiat-

ing the vorticity or divergence field will also be invalid.

This method of solution can in principle be applied to the fully compressible equations (21) provided . This

is related to theoretical results, see Lions (1996), which show that, if both solutions exist, there is a solution of the

compressible equations close to that of the incompressible equations, where closeness is measured in terms of

. The continuity equation which is enforced by the projection now expresses conservation of mass, rather than

non-divergence.

We can use the solution procedure to illustrate some other properties of the solution. If the first guess pressure is

chosen to be the hydrostatic pressure , then (27) becomes

(31)

The largest term that contributes to is thus removed. However, the horizontal derivatives of

may blow up. The non-hydrostatic pressure is still critical in order to enforce the continuity equation, even

though the total pressure may be dominated by the hydrostatic part.

If the rotation is rapid, then will be small, and the projection of onto a measure-

preserving mapping will be much simpler. Thus we can expect rapid rotation to improve the behaviour of the so-

lution.

5.3  Practical implications of solution procedure

We summarise the implications of the solution procedure set out in the previous subsection:

(i) Quasi-monotone schemes should be used, as good behaviour of the equations integrated along

particle paths (without the pressure gradient term) is required.

(ii) In support of this, note that ECMWF only obtained satisfactory behaviour of their model at T213

resolution after quasi-monotone schemes were introduced, (Temperton et al. 2001). Now they are in

use, satisfactory results at resolutions up to T799 have been obtained without further changes to the

schemes. Experience with very high resolution simulations, such as of bubble convection, is also

that monotone schemes are needed.

(iii) An elliptic problem has to be solved to force the trajectories to satisfy the continuity equation and

boundary conditions. Implicit recalculation of the trajectories in semi-Lagrangian methods is

needed.

(iv) Eulerian methods should be designed to be equivalent to semi-Lagrangian methods, i.e. to upwind

quasi-monotone interpolation. Note that the derivatives nominally approximated by Eulerian

methods may not exist, but derivations based on characteristics will be valid. Flux form schemes

have the advantage of enforcing the continuity and boundary conditions exactly.

We demonstrate point (iii) by computations using an anelastic model developed by P. Smolarkiewicz. The explicit

version of this model is described in Smolarkiewicz and Margolin (1997) and the implicit version by Smolarkie-

wicz et al. (1999). The area of integration was 2000km square. All integrations shown used 91 levels with a 300m

vertical spacing and a semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit scheme with a 5 minute time-step. The lower boundary con-

dition was free-slip, and no viscosity or turbulence model was used. The example is of flow at 10 ms-1 impinging

on the Scandinavian orography.

Figure 13 shows the flow at the bottom level of the model and the flow Jacobian at the bottom level. The flow Jaco-

bian is the ratio of the volume of fluid at the beginning and end of a time-step as inferred from the departure point

calculation in the semi-Lagrangian scheme. The values should be 1. The errors range from +19% to -28%, and are

largest in the region where experiments with a shorter time-step and more accurate boundary condition show the

numerical errors in the flow are greatest.

correcting these errors.

5.4  The hydrostatic approximation

Though the hydrostatic equations are normally written in pressure coordinates, for uniformity we write the approx-

imation directly into (21) as

(32)

These equations almost certainly blow up in an irrecoverable way. Suppose is uniform, then it will remain so for

all time. Then is independent of and , and are independent of . If, initially, and depend on

, the pressure gradient term, which is independent of , will be unable to prevent fluid trajectories colliding, as

in the example of 3.2. The equation of state constrains , in particular, if are smooth, is also smooth.

The continuity equation then requires to tend to infinity. There is no known way of resolving the difficulty in

two dimensions analogous to the one-dimensional construction of 3.2. Either viscosity or non-hydrostatic pressure

has to be introduced. However, if and are initially independent of , they remain so for all time and two-

dimensional theory can be used to show that the problem can be solved.

Scale analysis shows that the hydrostatic approximation is only valid on time-scales greater than the reciprocal of

the buoyancy frequency, . Typical values are 100s (a period of 600s) in the troposphere and

10s (a period of 60s) in the stratosphere. However, in moist saturated neutral regions of the atmosphere, ,

assuming phase changes are instantaneous. The current ECMWF model timestep is 900s for a horizontal resolution

of 40km. Thus we can expect to resolve the typical period when the hydrostatic equations break down at about a

10km resolution. However, it will break down locally in weakly stratified regions before this.

In the above example, . Thus the hydrostatic approximation is invalid, and the breakdown of the solution

should be resolved by including a non-hydrostatic pressure rather than viscosity. In the current ECMWF semi-im-

plicit scheme, a reference basic state with a large static stability is used in the implicit step. This introduces a com-

putational non-hydrostatic pressure of , where is the buoyancy frequency of the reference

state. This is sufficient to stabilise the model. However, it may introduce errors into the simulation. Figure 15 shows

the effect of changing the reference profile averaged over 12 forecasts with the ECMWF model (CY23R4) at T511

resolution.

The hydrostatic equations, unlike the anelastic equations, can be solved explicitly. However, even in the UK Met

Office explicit Unified Model (Cullen and Davies (1991), a reference profile is used in the short time-steps which

compute the pressure gradient and vertical advection, so that the same stabilisation mechanism is present. It is im-

portant to remember that a hydrostatic model stabilised this way will not give correct solutions where the stratifi-

6. AVERAGED EQUATIONS

6.1  Averaged equations, and their approximation by balanced models

The preceding sections have discussed exact equations and approximations to them which are valid for subsonic

flow. However, it is clear that operational models greatly under-resolve the solutions of these equations, as illus-

trated by the observations reviewed in Section 2. In practice, it is more realistic to view them as solving equations

that have been averaged in space and time. This is well-known to large-eddy modellers, who are always disciplined

in defining averaging scales in the problems they solve.

Figure 4 illustrates that averaging will involve compromises. For instance, a horizontal averaging scale of 80km,

compatible with the T511 ECMWF model resolution of 40km, cuts through the dominant scale of frontal zones

and of internal and external gravity waves. The planned resolution of 15km achievable later in the decade is com-

patible with a 30km averaging scale, which is still in the most active scale for mesoscale weather systems and grav-

ity waves. Thus accurate representation of these phenomena will not be possible.

Theory also shows that averaging involves compromises. Averaged equations include terms representing correla-

tions between resolved and unresolved motions, which can only be modelled empirically. They thus never have the

fundamental validity of the original equations. Accurate deterministic prediction with averaged equations can only

be expected if there is a spectral gap, which means that interactions between resolved and unresolved flows will be

weak. However, Figure 3 shows that there is no such gap in atmospheric data. Accurate prediction is also possible

if the averaging can select resolved and unresolved processes which interact weakly for other reasons. For instance,

flows which are almost entirely rotational interact weakly with flows that are almost entirely divergent. This situ-

ation is only likely if the averaging reflects a physically important scale of the flow. However, in weather forecast-

ing, typical resolutions are finer than the Rossby radius, above which the rotational constraint dominates, but not

fine enough to resolve all the key scales associated with stratification.

If the equations are averaged in space and time in a Eulerian sense, and the sub-grid model is correct, the solutions

must be smooth on the averaging scale because the real flow is smooth when averaged to this scale. The analysis

of section 5.2 suggests that this will be achieved in an incompressible non-hydrostatic incompressible model by

using monotone advection schemes and implicit calculation of trajectories. This has been verified by computations

using the same model as used in section 5.3. However, it is important that sub-grid modelling of motions which are

sub-grid scale but have a major large-scale impact, such as convection, need to assume that their input data repre-

sents averaged values and be designed so that the solution of the resolved and sub-grid models together stays

smooth on the averaging scale.

There is no reason why the form of the unaveraged Navier-Stokes equations has to be retained once the equations

are averaged. For instance, the hydrostatic equations become appropriate when the averaging scale is greater than

about 15km, as the regions of weak stability where the hydrostatic equations blow up are no longer resolved. An-

other possibility is discussed by Gent and McWilliams (1996), and is widely used in ocean models. Averaging the

advection term  gives

(33)

assuming that perturbation quantities average to zero. The final term can be modelled in terms of mean quantities

as , where is the antisymmetric part and the symmetric part. can be modelled as advection by

a ‘bolus’ velocity, e.g. Stokes drift or ‘entrainment velocity’. This provides a non-diffusive element to the sub-grid

model, and allows smoothness to be achieved without relying entirely on diffusion.

Ideally, we would like to average without imposing smoothness, so as to capture sharp changes such as that illus-

trated in Figure 6. One possible method is to use Lagrangian averaging, so that we average over air parcels as they

move in space and time, but allow different air masses to be separated by sharp boundaries. An example of this

approach is set out by Andrews and McIntyre (1978) and Buhler and McIntyre (1998). They show that the Lagrang-

ian mean momentum equation takes the from

(34)

is the ‘pseudo-momentum’ associated with the waves removed by averaging. The trajectory is defined by the

‘Lagrangian mean’ velocity. is a perturbation pressure. Once again we see that the trajectory is defined by a dif-

ferent velocity from the momentum.

A natural averaging scale is given by the inertial frequency . The semi-geostrophic model is an accurate approx-

imation to (34) if . It is obtained by neglecting and assuming is in ge-

ostrophic balance. This model can be proved to have solutions, e.g. Cullen and Purser (1989), Benamou and

Brenier (1998), but the condition restricts its accuracy to scales greater than

the Rossby radius (Cullen, 2000). Accuracy of semi-Lagrangian advection schemes requires that

, which is a condition of the same form but much less restrictive at opera-

tional resolutions. The current operational resolution,T511, is integrated with a 15 minute time-step. The accuracy

condition is thus 12 times less restrictive than the semi-geostrophic condition in middle latitudes. It thus allows a

wider variety of solutions, such as inertial waves.

Another natural scale is defined by the condition that the Froude number is small. This requires internal

gravity waves to propagate faster than the advection velocity. In the ECMWF model with 60 levels, only 5 vertical

modes have a phase speed greater than 100ms-1, and only 15 greater than 30ms-1. Thus balanced models based on

fast gravity wave speeds are only likely to work with limited vertical resolution.

A finer natural averaging scale would be given by the buoyancy frequency. As discussed in section 5.4, this is not

resolved in operational models. Thus we either have to accept a mixture of well- and partly-resolved motions, or

impose a rather restrictive averaging scale.

6.2  Computations of averaged solutions.

Since the averaging scales used in operational models do not correspond to a physical scale separation, even the

correct averaged behaviour may not look like what is expected. We illustrate with an example of flow over Scan-

dinavia shown in Figure 16. There is a north-westerly flow roughly at right angles to the Scandinavian orography.

A satellite picture at the same time, Figure 17, shows possible wave activity over the mountains, but skies are clear

over the Baltic. Thus we expect that the solution of the equations will contain large vertical motions over the orog-

model at T319 resolution is shown in Figure 18. The cross-section line extends across the Baltic. However, the

model orography, shown in the cross-section, has a downslope which also extends half-way across where the Baltic

should be. The cross-section shows vertical motions extending right across the Baltic. However, they may well be

a realistic representation of how the atmosphere would have responded to the model orography. Other experiments

(not shown) show that the model waves are not numerical artefacts.

We show that the forecasts from the operational model may well be accurate forecasts of the averaged state of the

atmosphere by using the research model used in section 5.3. The problem solved is exactly as in 5.3. We compare

integrations with a 10km grid where the results are averaged to a 80km grid with results from the model with a

40km grid. Because of numerical errors, we can only expect results from a 40km grid to be verifiable at 80km res-

olution. The agreement is quite good, both for the low-level flow, Figure 19, and for the vertical motion, Figure 20.

The operational model used to produce Figure 18 has a resolution of about 60km. The results shown in Figure 20

are sufficiently similar to this to suggest that the operational model may be giving a reasonable prediction of the

averaged flow. A similar comparison was made between a 20km model and the 10km results averaged to 40km.

Again there was reasonable agreement.

6.3  Balanced models

As discussed in section 5.1, the exact equations governing the atmosphere support 5 time-like solutions. Two of

these can be filtered will little loss in accuracy because the flow is very subsonic. However, we cannot further re-

duce the equations to give a system with one time-like variable by eliminating inertio-gravity waves and retain ac-

curacy in all circumstances. This is because the inertio-gravity wave frequency, (22), is similar to the advection

frequency under many circumstances. In order to obtain a ‘balanced model’ with a single time-like solution, we

must assume that either the Rossby number , the Froude number , or the aspect ratio is

small. The resulting equations will have much simpler solutions than either the full equations, (21), or the anelastic

approximation (25). Typically they can be described by advection of potential vorticity, together with the solution

of an elliptic problem to obtain the other variables, Hoskins et al. (1985). However, we can expect the solutions to

be accurate approximations to those of the full equations on large scales.

An example is shown in Figure 21. This is a sequence of ECMWF analyses of potential vorticity in the upper trop-

osphere and accumulated precipitation. We can see the close relation between the movement and development of

the potential vorticity anomaly with the main areas of precipitation. It is likely that this correspondence would be

retained in a balanced model, though the small scale detail would be lost.

There are many examples of balanced models, based on different expansions in Rossby or Froude numbers or as-

pect ratio. Two examples are the balance equations, and the semi-geostrophic model. The former is a much more

accurate approximation in the context of the shallow water equations, Cullen (2000), but in three dimensions is

liable to spontaneous instability McWilliams et al. (1998). The semi-geostrophic model can always be solved, Cul-

len and Purser (1989), Benamou and Brenier (1998), giving a ‘slow manifold’, but the solutions will not be as ac-

curate. This reflects the complexity of the true solution, forcing a choice between an accurate local approximation

by a simple model or a less accurate global approximation. Figure 22 is a schematic illustration of this choice. The

thin line represents the exact solution of the equations of motion. The thick solid line represents the Lagrangian

mean, with occasional sharp changes. The short-dashed line represents the semi-geostrophic solution, which is

much simpler than the solution of the equations of motion, as many types of motion are filtered. The solution al-

ways exists but slowly loses accuracy. The long-dashed line represents the solution of the more accurate balance

equations, which cannot be solved under all conditions. The breakdowns will usually correspond to places where

the exact solution does not behave smoothly, so cannot be closely approximated by a simpler solution McWilliams

et al., 1998).

Figure  22. Schematic graph of solution curves of exact, averaged and approximate models.

A practical difficulty with the use of balance techniques in operational models is the solution of the elliptic problem

to derive other variables from the potential vorticity. In order to derive the divergence, or vertical motion, or age-

ostrophic wind; we have to solve an ‘omega’ equation. This takes the generic form

(35)

The accuracy of the balanced model assumes that the eigenvalues of are large, so that a realistic estimate of the

vertical motion is produced from the forcing . However, as discussed in section 6.1, balance assumptions are

not applicable on the smaller horizontal and vertical scales resolved by the ECMWF model, and this will be asso-

ciated with small eigenvalues of . For instance, there are 11 vertical modes in the 60 level model with internal

gravity wave speeds less than 3ms-1. Straightforward application of (35) will thus lead to very large and unrealistic

results. This is why, for instance, nonlinear normal mode initialisation cannot be used for more than about 5 vertical

modes.

6.4  Structure of the solution of the semi-geostrophic model

As shown in section 6.1, the semi-geostrophic model is most usefully considered as an approximation to the aver-

aged equations, so we must include the sub-grid model terms. In these notes we cannot consider more than a very

limited part of the sub-grid model. A fuller discussion of this material is included in Cullen and Salmond (2002).

The semi-geostrophic equations can then be written as:

(36)

The boundary layer friction is represented by vertical diffusion, and is a thermodynamic source term. The mix-

ing coefficient is computed only from the balanced variables. The last equation of (36) has been modified to

include the friction terms, so that geostrophic balance has been replaced by Ekman balance, hence the suffix .

Write the last equation of (36) in the form , where is a matrix operator. The equations can

then be written, following Schubert (1985) as

We have allowed additionally for the effects of moisture, not included in (36), by using to represent the potential

temperature in unsaturated regions and the moist equivalent potential temperature in saturated regions, and

to represent a non-local matrix describing the convective plumes.

Equation (37) shows that the rate of change of the balanced pressure is driven by the forcing term . The response

to the forcing, expressed as the total wind , is determined by the potential vorticity matrix . contains

geostrophic advection, radiation, and vertical diffusion, all of which have slow time-scales. If contains fast time

scales (compared to ), this decomposition is inappropriate. It is equally important not to force operational mod-

els on fast time-scales, since the response is unlikely to be modelled realistically.

The PV matrix includes the stabilising effect of boundary layer friction, and the destabilising effect of moisture.

If the atmosphere is stable to moist (slantwise) ascent, the first matrix term in (38) has all positive eigenvalues. If

an eigenvalue becomes zero, the smooth transport velocity is replaced by mixing over the region where

the zero eigenvalue exists. If there is a negative eigenvalue, the second term, which represents the non-local effects

of convection, comes into play. A ‘correct’ convective parametrisation for the full equations (21) should ensure that

the total  has no negative eigenvalues, or else the model will still support explicit convective instability.

It can be proved, Cullen and Purser (1989), that there is an essentially unique choice of trajectory that satisfies (37),

and maintains a pressure whose implied geostrophic wind and temperature are inertially and statically stable. If the

actual state is potentially unstable to moist convection, this solution will include convective plumes, as illustrated

in Figure 23, and discussed in more detail by Shutts et al. (1988). Real states which are statically or inertially un-

stable evolve on time-scales faster than , so that the semi-geostrophic approximation is inappropriate. The ef-

fect of the approximation is to force such fast motions to happen instantaneously, so that there is a sharp boundary

between ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ motions. As shown earlier in Figure 3, this is a simplification of the real case, where there

are no sharp distinctions. In operational models of resolution similar to ECMWF, Figure 4 shows that there is not

enough resolution to treat many ‘fast’ motions accurately, so they have to be parametrised. The practical situation

is thus not that different from the simplified picture of equation (37).

Since the trajectory is determined implicitly by the forcing, implicit calculation of the trajectory is preferred in op-

erational models. The boundary layer friction, which appears in the lowest order balance, and the convective mass

transport, should also be determined implicitly.

Figure 24 and Figure 25 show the effect of using a predictor-corrector scheme to integrate the dynamics and physics

in CY23R4 of the ECMWF model. Further details are given in Cullen and Salmond (2002). In this scheme each

time-step is repeated, allowing implicit adjustment of the trajectories and the parametrised transports. Figure 25

shows that the effect is larger than that obtained by simply halving the timestep. Figure 24 shows that it is compa-

rable, except at the end of the forecast range, to the difference made by changing the horizontal resolution from

T319 to T511.

7. SUMMARY

We have discussed the properties of some very simple models which are relevant to aspects of atmospheric flow,

and then illustrated how they give information about the solution of the complete problem. The main points which

are relevant to the design of operational models are summarised below.

(i) The full solutions of the equations of motion have well-behaved solutions, but they are far too

detailed to compute correctly in operational models.

(ii) Simplifications of the full equations may or may not have well-behaved solutions. The hydrostatic

equations do not have solutions for weak stratification. The semi-geostrophic equations always

have solutions, but these only describe relatively large scale flow where rotation is dominant.

(iii) Accurate solution of the complete equations for high Reynolds number subsonic flow (the relevant

case) requires implicit determination of the trajectory and solution of an elliptic problem. Proper

treatment of rigid boundaries is particularly important.

(iv) Operational models are most realistically thought of as solutions of averaged equations. Only

certain averaging scales correspond to physical scale separations, other choices of scale will not be

so effective in practice. The average of a real atmospheric state may not look like what one would

expect.
