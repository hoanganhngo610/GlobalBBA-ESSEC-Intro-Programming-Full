The parametrization of the planetary boundary layer

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1  The planetary boundary layer

The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the region of the atmosphere near the surface where the influence of the

surface is felt through turbulent exchange of momentum, heat and moisture. The equations which describe the

large-scale evolution of the atmosphere do not take into account the interaction with the surface. The turbulent mo-

tion responsible for this interaction is small-scale and totally sub-grid and therefore needs to be parametrized.

The transition region between the surface and the free atmosphere, where vertical diffusion due to turbulent motion

takes place, varies in depth. The PBL can be as shallow as 100 m during night over land and go up to a few thousand

metres when the atmosphere is heated from the surface. The PBL parametrization determines together with the sur-

face parametrization the surface fluxes and redistributes the surface fluxes over the boundary layer depth. Boundary

layer processes are relatively quick; the PBL responds to its forcing within a few hours which is fast compared to

the time scale of the large-scale evolution of the atmosphere, in other words: the PBL is always in quasi-equilibrium

with the large-scale forcing.

1.2  Importance of the PBL in large-scale models

A number of reasons exists to have a realistic representation of the boundary layer in a large scale model:

• The large-scale budgets of momentum heat and moisture are considerably affected by the surface

fluxes on time scales of a few days.

• Model variables in the boundary layer are important model products.

• The boundary layer interacts with other processes e.g. clouds and convection.

The importance of the surface fluxes can be illustrated by estimating the recycle time of the different quantities on

the basis of typical values of the surface fluxes. The numbers in Table 1 have been derived from a typical run with

the ECMWF model or are simply order of magnitudes estimations.

Already from these very crude estimates it can be seen that the surface fluxes play an important role in forecasting

for the medium range. It is obvious that the surface fluxes are crucial for the “climate” of the model. With regard

to the momentum budget it should be noted that the Ekman spin-down time has to be considered as the relevant

time scale because it is an efficient mechanism for spinning down vorticity in the entire atmosphere by frictional

stress in the PBL only.

The second important reason to have a PBL scheme in a large-scale model is that forecast products are needed near

the surface. The temperature and wind at standard observation height (2 m and 10 m for temperature and wind re-

spectively) are obvious products. It is important to realize that the PBL scheme together with the land surface and

radiation scheme introduces the diurnal pattern in the surface fields. Also the analysed and forecasted fields of sur-

face fluxes (momentum, heat and moisture) are becoming more and more important as input and verification for

wave models, air pollution models and climate models.

Finally it has to be realized that other processes can not be parametrized properly without having a PBL scheme.

Boundary layer clouds are an obvious example, but also convection schemes often use surface fluxes of moisture

in their closure.

1.4  General characteristics of the planetary boundary layer

Turbulence

The diffusive processes in the atmospheric boundary are dominated by turbulence. The molecular diffusion can in

general be neglected except in a shallow layer (a few mm only) near the surface. The time scale of the turbulent

motion ranges from a few seconds for the small eddies to about half an hour for the biggest eddies (see Fig. 1 ).

The length scales vary from millimetres for the dissipative fluctuations to a few hundred metres for the eddies in

the bulk of the boundary layer. The latter ones dominate the diffusive properties of the turbulent boundary layer. It

is clear that these scales cannot be resolved by large-scale models and need to be parametrized.

shown.

Stability

The structure of the atmospheric boundary layer is influenced by the underlying surface and by the stability of the

PBL (see Fig. 2 ).

The surface roughness determines to a certain extent the amount of turbulence production, the surface stress and

the shape of the wind profile. Stability influences the structure of turbulence. In an unstably stratified PBL (e.g.

during day-time over land with an upward heat flux from the surface) the turbulence production is enhanced and

the exchange is intensified resulting in a more uniform distribution of momentum, potential temperature and spe-

cific humidity. In a stably stratified boundary layer (e.g. during night-time over land) the turbulence produced by

shear is suppressed by the stratification resulting in a weak exchange and a weak coupling with the surface. The

qualitative impact of these aspect is illustrated in Fig. 2

Diurnal pattern

The typical evolution of the PBL over land is illustrated in Fig. 3 for a 24 hour interval. During daytime, with an

upward heat flux from the surface, the turbulent mixing is very strong, resulting in approximately uniform profiles

of potential temperature and wind over the bulk of the boundary layer. The unstable boundary layer is therefore

often called “mixed layer”. Near the surface we see a super adiabatic layer and a strong wind gradient. The top of

the mixed layer is capped by an inversion which inhibits the turbulent motion (e.g. the rising thermals) to penetrate

aloft. The inversion height rises quickly early in the morning an reaches a height of a few kilometres during day-

time. When the heat flux from the surface changes sign at night the turbulence in the mixed layer dies out and a

shallow stable layer near the surface develops. The nocturnal boundary layer has a height of typically 50 to 200 m

dependent on wind speed and stability.

of the model, the model performance in the medium range and play an integral role in a number of parametriza-

tions. The diurnal pattern of the PBL over land is mainly forced by the energy budget at the surface through the

diurnal evolution of the net radiation at the surface as illustrated in Fig. 4 . During daytime the net radiation is par-

titioned between the heat flux into the ground, the sensible heat flux into the atmosphere and the latent heat of evap-

oration. The ground heat flux is generally smaller than 10% of the net radiation during daytime. The partitioning

of available net radiation between sensible and latent heat is part of the land surface parametrization scheme. The

fluxes are much smaller during night-time and are much less important for the atmospheric budgets but equally

relevant for the prediction of boundary layer parameters.

The boundary layer over sea does not have a distinct diurnal pattern but can be stable and unstable dependent of

the air type that is advected relative to the sea surface temperature. Strong cold air advection over a relatively warm

sea can lead to extremely high fluxes of sensible and latent heat into the atmosphere. Warm air advection over a

cold sea leads to a stable PBL but does occur less frequently.

It is important to realize that the thermodynamic surface boundary conditions over sea are very different from those

over land. Over sea the temperature and specific humidity are specified and kept constant during the forecast. Over

land the surface boundary condition for temperature and moisture are nearly flux boundary conditions, because of

the constraint imposed by the surface energy budget. In the latter case, the fluxes are determined by the net radiation

at the surface. This means that the total energy input into the atmosphere (sensible + latent heat) is not so much

determined by the flow or by the PBL parametrization but by the net radiation at the surface. The sea however, is,

with its fixed SST boundary condition, an infinite source of energy to the model. The specification of the PBL ex-

change with the sea surface is therefore extremely critical. Beljaars and Miller (1991) give an example of model

sensitivity to the parametrization of surface fluxes over tropical oceans.

PBL clouds

Cumulus clouds, stratocumulus clouds and fog are very much part of the boundary layer dynamics and interact

strongly with radiation.

1.5  Conserved quantities and static stability

To describe vertical diffusion by turbulent motion we have to select variables that are conserved for adiabatic proc-

esses. In the hydrostatic approximation both potential temperature θ and dry static energy are conserved for dry
adiabatic ascent or descent. They are defined as

The static stability is determined by the density of a fluid parcel moved adiabatically to a reference height in com-

parison with the density of the surrounding fluid. The virtual potential temperature θv and the virtual dry static en-
ergy are often used for this purpose:

These equations describe the horizontal momentum budget of the resolved flow and have extra terms due to the

Reynolds decomposition and averaging procedure. The terms and are known as the Reynolds stresses

and represent vertical transport of horizontal momentum by unresolved turbulent motion. These are the terms that

need to be parametrized. Similar equations exist for potential temperature and specific humidity.

An equation that is important in some parametrization schemes and gives insight in the dynamics of turbulence is

the equation for turbulent kinetic energy. To derive it, the equations for the fluctuating quantities are taken by sub-

tracting the equations for mean momentum from the equations for total momentum. The kinetic energy of the fluc-

tuations is obtained by multiplying the equations for the different components by the velocity fluctuation itself and

by adding the three equations for the three components. The result is:

(14)

(15)

The left hand side of this equation represents time dependence and advection. The right hand side has source, sink

and transport terms. Terms I represent mechanical production of turbulence by wind shear and convert energy of

the mean flow into turbulence. Term two is the production of turbulence by buoyancy and converts potential energy

of the atmosphere to turbulence or vice versa. Terms III and IV are transport or turbulent diffusion terms because

they equal zero when vertically integrated over the domain. They represent the vertical transport of turbulence en-

ergy by the turbulent fluctuations and the pressure fluctuations respectively. The last term (V) is the dissipation term

which converts turbulence kinetic energy into heat by molecular friction at very small scales.

The vertical velocity #,+ at the top of the PBL is derived from the continuity equation by integration from the sur-
face to boundary layer depth - , where -  is large.

(20)

We see that the vertical velocity at the top of the PBL is proportional to the curl of the surface stress and to the curl

of the geostrophic wind. This qualitative result is in fact independent of how ' is exactly specified. The vertical
velocity can bee seen as a boundary condition for the inviscid flow above the boundary layer. The inflow of air in

a cyclone due to friction at the surface causes an ascending motion at the top of the PBL and spins down the vortex

by vortex compression (conservation of angular momentum). This mechanism is very important because it trans-

fers the effect of boundary layer friction to the entire troposphere. Ekman pumping is illustrated in Fig. 5 .

2. SIMILARITY THEORY AND SURFACE FLUXES

Many physical processes in the atmosphere are too complicated to enable the derivation of parametrizations on the

basis of first principles. Turbulence is such an example: although turbulent fluctuations are described by the equa-

tions of motion for a continuum fluid, it is very difficult to generate solutions of these equations and moreover the

solutions show chaotic behaviour on very short time scales. Most of the time we are only interested in statistical

averages. It is therefore common practice to rely on empirical relationships based on observations. Similarity the-

ory provides the framework to organize and group the experimental data.

Similarity theory starts with the identification of the relevant physical parameters, then dimensionless groups are

formed from the these parameters, and finally experimental data is used to find functional relations between dimen-

sionless groups. When the functional relations are known, they can be used as part of a parametrization scheme.

Because experimental data is always noisy and shows a lot of scatter it is important to limit as much as possible the

number of dimensionless groups. It may for instance be difficult to find an empirical representation of noisy data

when more than one or two independent parameters are involved. It is therefore advantageous to consider different

parts of the boundary layer (surface layer, outer layer) and different limiting cases (neutral, very unstable etc.) sep-

arately, to simplify the problem and to limit the number of dimensionless groups that are relevant at the same time.

The procedures are straightforward in principle (the Buckingham Pi dimensional analysis method; see e.g. Stull,

1988), but require experience and intuition in practice. The judgment of which parameters are important or unim-

portant is a crucial aspect of the analysis.

Similarity theory is used in virtually all PBL schemes that have been developed for atmospheric models. Different

aspects of the boundary layer similarity are discussed in the following sections.

2.1  Surface-layer similarity

The surface layer is the shallow fraction of the PBL near the surface where the fluxes are approximately equal to

the surface values. The surface layer is therefore often called the constant flux layer. Although the definition implies

that �/. - is much smaller than 1 in the surface layer, in practice the upper limit is often defined as the height where

The dimensionless gradient functions (27)–(30) have been studied extensively with help of field experiments over

Examples of wind profiles according to the empirical forms of (45) and (48) are shown in Fig. 7 in comparison

It is clear that these functions play a crucial role in parametrization schemes. The gradient functions provide direct

expressions for exchange coefficients as they relate fluxes to gradients. The integral profile functions are generally

used in models that have a model level in the surface layer to specify the profiles between the lowest model level

and the surface. The expressions (41) to (44) can in fact be seen as finite difference forms for the layer between the

surface and the lowest model level.

Limiting cases in surface layer similarity

In determining analytical forms for the similarity functions it is often useful to consider their asymptotic behaviour.

The neutral limit (�/. � = 0) and the free convection limit (A �/. � >>1) are of particular interest because they provide
information to limit the degrees of freedom in choosing analytical expressions.

In the neutral limit with �/. � = 0, the Obukhov length drops out as a relevant scale and therefore the dimensionless

wind gradient has to be constant. The dimensional wind gradient φM is by definition equal to 1 because the empirical
constant is absorbed in the definition and is called the Von Karman constant. The exact value of the Von Karman

constant has been subject of considerable debate. Values between 0.35 and 0.42 have been proposed, but 0.4 is the

most widely accepted value now (e.g. Hogstrom, 1988).

The other limiting case with – �/. � >> 1 is called the free convection limit. A large value for – �/. � implies that
the production of turbulence by buoyancy is much larger than the production by wind shear and that the friction

velocity � * is irrelevant as scaling quantity. The only way to obtain independence of � * in the dimensionless po-
tential temperature gradient expression is by choosing a 1/3 power law for – �/. � >> 1, as � is proportional to �
by definition:

(50)

Alternatively a convective velocity scale can be defined based on the on the buoyancy flux

(51)

resulting in

(52)

The free convection velocity represents physically the velocity that large eddies (e.g. thermals) typically have in

the convective boundary layer. It should be noted that equation (35) does not satisfy the constraint as imposed by

the free convection limit. In practice however (35) fits data as accurately as expressions that tend to

for large – �/. � .
Another example of the free convection limit is the scaling relation for the variances of velocity and temperature

fluctuations (see also Fig. 8 ):

(53)

(54)

With the definitions of
�

and θ* it can be verified that � * drops out of these relations. Alternatively the same forms
can be expressed in terms of the free convection velocity without using � *. The advantage of the expression in z/L
is that it provides a limiting form for large �/. � . These examples clearly illustrate the strength of similarity theory.
For the neutral and free convection limit the similarity arguments even provide the shape of the functions, experi-

ments are only needed to determine the value of the constants (e.g. the Von Karman constant).

2.2  The outer layer

The outer layer of the PBL is the remaining part of the boundary layer above the surface layer. The fluxes are not

constant as in the surface layer but decrease monotonically from their surface values to small values at the top of

the PBL (see Fig. 9 for the convective boundary layer). The surface layer parameters are also relevant in the outer

layer. Additionally, the boundary layer height - (length scale) and in the extratropics the Coriolis parameter � (in-
verse time scale) enter the problem.

Neutral PBL

If the boundary layer height is not determined externally (e.g. by a capping inversion) but by the boundary layer

processes themselves then the boundary layer height must be proportional to the only length scale in the problem

namely ��B . � . The relevant parameters are: � *, � , and � ; the velocity profiles are usually written as differences with
the geostrophic wind as so-called velocity defect laws:

Convective boundary layer (mixed layer scaling)

In the convective boundary layer the PBL height is determined by a capping inversion at height - which can be
interpreted as an independent parameter. Formally also the friction velocity � * and the Coriolis parameter � play a
role. They are often omitted because the wind turning is small in the well mixed layer and – �/. � (which is by def-
inition larger than – 0.1 - . � ) is often large. The remaining relevant parameters are , - , and � � from which
we define:

(57)

(58)

The dimensionless gradients of wind temperature and specific humidity are not very interesting in this case because

the gradients are very small. The turbulent exchange is so strong in the convective boundary layer that the profiles

are nearly uniform (well mixed). Mixed layer scaling, however, applies to velocity and temperature fluctuations

e.g. σ D  /w*, σ E  /w*, σ F  /w* and σθ /θ* are functions of �/. - (see Fig. 10  for σ DHGIEJGKF ).
Stable boundary layer (local scaling)

The same principles as used for the convective boundary layer could be applied to the stable boundary layer. How-

ever, the friction velocity can not be omitted as friction is the only source of turbulence production.

To limit the number of independent parameters Nieuwstadt (1984) introduced the idea of local scaling which can

be made plausible in the following way. In the stable boundary layer turbulence is generated by shear production

and destroyed by buoyancy and viscous dissipation. Since buoyancy is acting in the vertical component it tends to

limit the vertical extent over which the mixing takes place and therefore limits the turbulence length scale. The de-

coupling of turbulence from the surface suggest that the local fluxes might be more suitable as direct scaling pa-

rameters. The strength of this idea lies in the fact that the resulting functions are necessarily the same as the ones

for the surface layer since the local fluxes are equal to the surface fluxes when the surface is approached. Thismeans

that experimental data from the surface layer and the outer layer can be combined. For models with local closure

(as in the ECMWF model) it also means that the closure scheme for the surface layer and the outer layer can be the

same.

In the framework of local scaling the relevant parameters are: the local fluxes and ,the buoyancy pa-

rameter � /θv and height � . From these we define:

(59)

Local scaling implies that dimensionless quantities are functions of �/. Λ instead of �/. � . Examples of local scaling
are given in Fig. 12 ; the height dependence of momentum and heat fluxes is illustrated in Fig. 11 .

For large �/. Λ the turbulence length scale is Λ and the presence of the surface should have no influence. This im-
plies that � should drop out of the scaling relations. The consequence for the dimensionless gradient functions is
that they become linear in �/. Λ for large �/. Λ because they have � as a length scale in their definition. The principle
that dimensionless functions become independent of � is called � -less scaling. The consequence in Fig. 12 is that
the empirical functions tend to a constant for large �1. Λ.
The different scaling regimes of the boundary layer are summarized in Fig. 13 for the unstable and stable PBL.The

dimensionless height �/. - and the dimensionless stability parameter - . � are used to delineate the different scaling
regimes.

2.3  Matching of surface and outer layer (drag laws)

The profile functions for the neutral outer layer written in velocity defect form must be logarithmic for

The constants O and P can be measured and express in dimensionless form the drag and the ageostrophic angle of
the surface wind with respect to the geostrophic forcing. Such “drag-laws” can be applied directly to models that

do not resolve the PBL, but are also an important diagnostic tool. In models that do resolve the boundary layer, the

drag law can be computed (e.g. in one column tests) and compared with data for the steady state PBL (see Fig. 14 ).

For non-neutral flow it is often assumed that O and P are functions of the stability parameter . Such
an assumption is quite arbitrary but works fairly well in practice.

2.4  Surface boundary conditions and surface fluxes

The parametrization of the PBL introduces at the same time the need for boundary conditions at the surface. The

boundary conditions are simply vanishing velocity and specified temperatures and specific humidities at the sur-

face. Over sea the temperature is specified and the specific humidity is the saturation value at the sea surface tem-

perature. Specification of temperature and specific humidity over land is part of the land surface parametrization

scheme. In some models, however, the surface energy balance equation is used over land to eliminate the surface

temperature and surface specific humidity. This is often referred to as the Penman Monteith concept (see Monteith

1981), which is not discussed here.

Looking more carefully at the boundary conditions, one realizes that an additional parametrization problem arises.

The boundary conditions are connected to the surface roughness lengths which are extremely important to the sur-

face fluxes. To illustrate this we assume that we have a model level near the surface in the constant flux layer at a

specified height � 1 (in the ECMWF model m). The surface layer profiles are used to specify the boundary
condition:

(65)

(66)

(67)

(68)

The logarithmic profiles are written in a way that � , ! , θ and � have their surface values for � = 0 (a displacement
height equal to the roughness length has been added to the vertical coordinate). The integration constants in the

logarithmic profiles are called roughness lengths because they are related to the small scale surface inhomogenei-

ties that determine the surface drag. In general the viscous forces play no role at all in the surface drag (except over

a very smooth sea); the pressure forces on the roughness elements transfer the wind stress to the surface (form drag)

and do so more efficiently than viscous forces because the height of roughness elements tends to be larger than the

thickness of the viscous layer. For heat and moisture the situation is slightly different. Form drag has no equivalent

for scalar quantities. The air-surface transfer is through an inter-facial sub-layer where molecular transfer dom-

nates. This implies that the roughness lengths for momentum, heat and moisture are generally different.

2-dimensional sinusoidal orography with amplitude 7 . Different models are compared (Taylor et al. 1989).

It is important to realize that the specification of the surface roughness lengths is an important aspect of the para-

metrization since the they determine to a large extent the surface fluxes. The roughness length is a surface charac-

teristic and is related to its geometry, but the only way to define it is by means of the logarithmic profile. Measuring

the logarithmic profile well away from the surface is the only way of determining � 0M for a uniform terrain. For a
large scale model with grid spacings of the order of 100 km many terrain inhomogeneities exist that affect the sur-

face drag. The effects of sub-grid terrain effects and sub-grid orography are accounted for by defining and “effec-

tive roughness length”, which is defined as the roughness length that gives the correct surface flux in the

parametrization. The roughness lengths are often derived from land-use maps with an extra contribution from the

variance of the sub-grid orography (see Table 2). A data base for land use is provide by Wilson and Henderson-

Sellers (1985). A review of sub-grid averaging is provided by Mason (1988) and Taylor et al. (1989). The issue of

sub-grid averaging of � 0H and � 0Q has only very recently received attention (see Wood and Mason 1991;Mason
1991; Beljaars and Holtslag, 1991).

Fig. 15 illustrates empirical data on the relation between the amplitude of not too steep sub-grid orography and the

aerodynamic roughness length. Steep orography is more difficult to parametrize (see Mason, 1988 for a review).

The difference between the roughness length for heat and momentum can be quite large as illustrated in Fig. 16 .

Recent studies suggest that terrain inhomogeneities have a large impact on the ratio � 0H and � 0M (see Mason 1991).
Specification of the surface roughness lengths over sea is even more important than over land particularly for heat

and moisture because with the fixed boundary conditions for temperature and moisture the sea is in principle an

infinite source of energy to the model. Currently the ECMWF model has equal values for momentum heat and

This parametrization does not satisfy the smooth surface limit at low wind speed where viscous forces dominate

(with scaling on ν . � B ). Furthermore Smith (1988) argues in a recent review that the increase of the roughness
length with increasing wind speed does not apply to heat and moisture. An alternative which combines the smooth

3.1  Geostrophic transfer laws

Geostrophic transfer laws can be used to introduce some effects of surface fluxes in models that have hardly any

or no levels in the boundary layer. They are based on boundary layer similarity for the steady state boundary layer.

A relation is assumed between the model variables at the lowest model level and the fluxes at the surface, where

the lowest model level is assumed to be at the top of the boundary layer or above the boundary layer. Such an ap-

proach makes only sense in models with low resolution near the surface. The simplest form of a bulk transfer law

expresses the surface fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture into the model variables � G, ! G, θG, � G above the
boundary layer and surface values θs and � s in the following way:

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

The index G has been used here to indicate variables above the boundary layer; for wind it can be thought of as

geostrophic wind. The constants , and are chosen from field data or adjusted on the basis of model

performance. Different values can be chosen for land and sea. Advantages of this scheme are: (i) the scheme is very

simple and (ii) it is a first order approximation for the influence of surface fluxes. Disadvantages are: (i) the scheme

does not have a diurnal cycle, (ii) there are no effects of stability, (iii) the empirical coefficients are very uncertain,

(iv) there are no forecast products in the PBL and (v) the physics of the PBL is poorly represented.

A second “bulk” scheme, which is very similar to the first one, introduces stability effects in the transfer coeffi-

cients ,  and  in accordance with the similarity theory discussed in Section 2.3.

where ,  or , (79)

   and , . (80)

The constant O depends on stability and is the same one as in Eq. (63). Experimental data on A is shown in Fig. 14
(Clarke and Hess 1974). This formulation is slightly more realistic than the first one but is very much limited to the

simple situations, for which the transfer laws are known. However, with an appropriate land surface scheme for the

surface temperature and surface moisture , this scheme allows for diurnal variation of the surface drag

through the stability dependence of parameter O . The more complicated case of the unsteady PBL, cases with
strong advection, baroclinic or inversion capped PBL’s are not expected to be well captured by bulk transfer laws.

3.2  Integral models (slab, bulk models)

In integral models the entire boundary layer is characterized by a limited number of parameters (e.g. PBL depth,

mean velocity, mean temperature etc.). Prognostic equations are derived for these PBL characteristics rather than

for the basic variables. The main advantage is that the PBL does not have to be resolved by the vertical layer struc-

ture of the model.

The basic assumption for integral models is that a similarity form exists for the model variables e.g. for potential

temperature:

, (81)

where is a temperature scale and - the boundary-layer height. When the form of f is known from field experi-
ments, Eq. (81) can be substituted in the equations of motion and integrated from the surface to � (W- . The resulting
differential equations for  and -  describe the entire PBL without resolving it explicitly in the vertical.

humidity approximately uniform in the bulk of the boundary layer (the simplest possible expression for f). The near

surface part shows gradients, but the surface layer is relatively shallow and does therefore not contribute signifi-

cantly to the budgets of the total boundary layer. Here we limit to the budget of potential temperature because it is

the main quantity that feeds back to the dynamics of the mixed layer. Quantity represents the potential temper-

ature in the bulk of the mixed layer and its time evolution is determined by heat fluxes at the surface and the top of

the mixed layer (Fig. 20 illustrates the temperature structure of the well mixed layer; see Driedonks and Tennekes,

In these equations represents the potential temperature jump at the top of the boundary layer, the entrain-

ment velocity, the large scale resolved vertical velocity at height - , and γ the stable lapse rate above the mixed
layer. Equations (82)–(85) describe the energy budget, the height and the temperature step at the top of the mixed

layer and have a simple physical interpretation. The rate of change of the energy of the mixed layer is proportional

to the difference of heat flux at the surface and the top (Eq. (82)); the height change of the mixed layer with respect

to the large scale ascent or descent is by definition the entrainment velocity (Eq. (83)); the temperature step at � (
- changes due to temperature changes of the mixed layer and due a shift of the mixed layer with respect to the
stable lapse rate (Eq. (84)); and the entrainment heat flux is the amount of air that is entrained times the temperature

jump (Eq. (84)). This set of equations is not closed; it has to be supplemented by equations for the surface fluxes

and by an entrainment assumption. The surface fluxes can be obtained by using surface layer formulations as dis-

cussed in Section 2.4. For the heat flux, Eq. (67) can be used with �  somewhere in the mixed layer and .
To parametrize the entrainment we consider the equation for turbulent kinetic energy:

This equation describes the balance between shear production (I), buoyancy production or destruction (II), trans-

port by turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations (III) and dissipation (IV). The order of magnitude of the differ-

ent terms typical for the entire mixed layer depth can be expressed in terms of velocity and length scales

These estimates have been made by assuming a single length scale - as turbulence length scale and for the estima-
tion of the derivatives and by assuming that the turbulent fluctuations have magnitude (see (57) for its defini-

tion). It is important to realize here what the mechanism of entrainment is. The energy is produced by shear and

buoyancy in the bulk of the mixed layer. Most of the energy is transferred to smaller and smaller scales and ulti-

mately converted into heat by viscous dissipation. Some of it is diffused upwards by the turbulent motion itself (e.g.

thermals) and penetrates into the inversion where it is destroyed by the negative buoyancy (Fig. 21 illustrates the

energy budget of the mixed layer). So the entrainment at the top of the mixed layer is fed by upward diffusion of

turbulent kinetic energy produced in the bulk of the mixed layer.

Since the dominant terms are of the order of , it is to be expected that the buoyancy flux at � (X- is also
proportional to this quantity. An obvious closure therefore is:

(87)

where the “entrainment” constant is determined from experimental data. The numerical value of is about

0.2 (Driedonks and Tennekes 1984).

The advantages of integral models are obvious: (i) they are relatively simple, (ii) they do not rely on vertical reso-

lution and (iii) they are physically realistic for simple cases as the mixed layer. Disadvantages are: (i) this type of

models is difficult to implement as they involve a moving boundary condition (the top of the boundary layer) for

the atmosphere above the PBL, (ii) the similarity profiles are less obvious for e.g. the stable boundary layer and

virtually unknown for more complicated boundary layers as e.g. the baroclinic or cloudy boundary layer and (iii)

the transition between different scaling regimes (e.g. from unstable to stable) are difficult to handle. For mixed layer

models in particular it has to be added that they perform very well for a well mixed quantity as potential tempera-

ture, but quite poorly for less well mixed quantities as momentum and specific humidity.

Because of the technical complications of having a moving lower boundary condition in a forecast model, Dear-

dorff (1972) proposed to combine the integral boundary layer approach with a fixed vertical grid structure. This

scheme was specially designed for GCM’s with poor vertical resolution. The diagnosed boundary layer height can

be below and above the lowest model level (Fig. 22 ). The boundary layer height can be seen as an additional model

level at the height where the structure of the atmosphere changes drastically. After every time step, with the PBL

scheme the grid points inside the boundary layer are adjusted to the mixed-layer profile.

General description

A fairly simple closure for models that resolve the boundary layer explicitly, is the ' -type closure. In analogy with
molecular diffusion, it is assumed that the fluxes are proportional to the gradients (Louis, 1979):

The exchange coefficient ' is not a property of the fluid as in molecular diffusion, but depends on the flow. Surface
layer similarity provides the formulation for '  near the surface (i.e. in the lowest model layer):

, (90)

where Z[( 3 � . Use of the same expression in the outer layer (above the lowest model level), would be consistent
with the ideas of local scaling (Section 2.2) for the stable boundary layer, provided that , and are pro-

portional to � for large �/. � . In this way the length scale � drops out for large � . Two problems arise from such a
simple extension of surface layer similarity both related to the lack of an upper bound to Z : (i) the diffusion coeffi-
cient becomes very large in neutral situations and (ii) with different from in stable situations (necessary for

reasons to be explained later), local scaling breaks down and Z remains an essential part of the parametrization. To
limit the length scale Blackadar (1962) proposed the following expression:

(91)

This formulation obeys surface layer similarity and is consistent with local scaling for the stable boundary layer.

The only additional parameter that has been introduced is the asymptotic length scale λ, which is often the same
for momentum and heat. The idea is that the turbulence length scale is limited by the boundary layer height. In

some parametrizations λ ~ �RQ . � or λ ~ - , where - is a diagnosed boundary layer height. Since the results are not
very sensitive to the exact value of Z , this parameter is often chosen constant.
Expressions (90) contain φ which depends on �/. � in the surface layer and therefore on the surface fluxes. Above
the surface layer the φ-functions depend on Z . 3 � instead of �/. � to be consistent with the ideas of local scaling.
An inconvenient aspect of Eq. (90) is that it contains fluxes which makes the closure an implicit one. To find an

explicit closure we substitute the closure assumptions in the definition of the Obukhov length and obtain:

(92)

This is a relation between the gradient Richardson number and Z . � which can be solved numerically when the φ-
functions are specified. Instead of closure assumption (90) it is much more efficient to specify stability functions

that depend on the Richardson number because then we have the fluxes explicitly in terms of model variables:

The gradients as needed in the closure assumption are computed from the grid point values by means of a finite

difference approximation (cf. Fig. 23 ). A staggered grid is used with flux levels between the full model levels. A

simple finite difference approximation (assuming linearly interpolated profiles between model levels) is not accu-

rate near the surface, where the profiles of wind temperature and moisture show pronounced non-linear behaviour

particularly near the surface. To derive a finite difference form for the surface layer we assume that the flux is con-

stant with height and integrate the closure assumptions from the surface to � ( � 1 where � 1 is the height of the lowest
model level. This results in the usual surface layer profiles:

The closure assumptions are hidden now in the empirical functions of the Richardson number, which are never

measured directly. The reason is that they depend on the surface conditions (surface roughness lengths) which

makes it difficult to determine them directly from data. Experiments, however, do provide data on the or func-

tions. From there we can derive numerically the \ functions for different surface roughness lengths and make an
empirical fit to be used in the forecast model. However the \ functions (104)–(106) depend on three different pa-
rameters and it can be difficult to obtain simple empirical expressions that are accurate for all possible vales of the

parameters. In many models the three roughness lengths are the same which reduces the number of independent

parameters to 2, but the empirical functions can still be fairly inaccurate as will illustrated subsequently.

The stability functions

The main difficulty with ' -closure is the specification of the stability functions. Louis et al. (1982) give an over-
view of how these function have evolved in the operational ECMWF model as the result of adjustments on the basis

physical arguments and model performance. The functions that have been used since December 1981 are (Louis et

al. 1982):

Extensive diagnostics of operational forecasts has shown that the diffusion was too strong in the middle and upper

troposphere, where the jet stream was partially smeared out by the action of the vertical diffusion scheme. It was

therefore decided to make a rough estimate of the boundary layer height and to switch off the scheme above the

boundary layer in stable situations. This change was introduced operationally in January 1988. The poor perform-

ance of the scheme above the boundary layer can be attributed to the shape of the stability function in the Richard-

son number range of 0.1 to 1.

An alternative form of the stability functions (the \ _ � *d^ functions) can be derived from the φ functions (34)–(35)
in unstable situations and (39)–(40) in stable flow. We will call them the M.O. functions. The comparison of the

stability functions is shown in Fig. 24 . We see that for positive Richardson numbers the functions derived from

and depend on the surface roughness length. The most pronounced difference above the surface layer is

that the M.O. functions give much smaller values above
� * = 0.1 in comparison to the Louis et al. (1982) functions.

It should be realized that the shape of the stability functions is subject to an ongoing debate (Hogstrom 1988). The

difficulties originate from limitations in the concept of local diffusion and from uncertainties in the experimental

data. An example of the first difficulty is the unstable or convective boundary layer where the diffusion is not local.

The reason that a local scheme still performs reasonably well is that the coefficients become large and therefore the

profiles virtually uniform irrespective of the exact magnitude of the diffusion coefficients. For quantities that are

not well mixed in the convective boundary layer as e.g. moisture or wind in a baroclinic PBL, a local scheme is

expected to be less appropriate. A second example of the same problem is diffusion in stably stratified flow in the

intermittent regime. Local scaling works fairly well in the fully turbulent regime up to Richardson numbers of 0.2.

Beyond 0.2, turbulence becomes intermittent and the diffusive characteristics are not well understood. Also wave-

turbulence interaction is a relevant process in this range. The reported magnitude of the diffusion coefficients in

clear-air turbulence (Richardson numbers between 0.2 and 1) varies by and order of magnitude from one study to

the other (Kennedy and Shapiro 1980; Ueda et al. 1981; Kondo et al. 1978; Nieuwstadt 1984; Kim and Mahrt

1991). The shape of functions and as expressed by Eqs. (39)–(40) is reasonably well documented (see Bel-

jaars and Holtslag 1991) for weak and moderate stability. The ratio , however, is inspired by the idea that

this ratio should become proportional
� * for large Richardson numbers (see Eq. (92)). This particular asymptotic

behaviour is much less documented, but is quit relevant to the transformation from �/. � to � * in Eq. (92). Another
parameter that determines to a large extent the diffusion in the clear-air turbulence domain is the asymptotic length

scale λ. A simple parametrization strategy is to select stability functions which are reasonably well documented
from

� * = 0 to � * = 0.2, apply physical constraints for large Richardson numbers as in Eqs. (39)–(40) and adjust
λ to obtain reasonable diffusion coefficients in the clear air turbulence domain e.g. on the basis of data by Kennedy
and Shapiro (1980).

One column simulations

To illustrate the characteristics of ' -closure, a single column version of the vertical diffusion scheme has been in-
tegrated over 9 hours with constant geostrophic forcing and constant forcing from the surface. In this way, a nearly

steady state is obtained. The selected forcing is a constant geostrophic wind of 10 m/s and a constant surface heat

flux. The surface roughness length is 0.1 m. Fig. 25 shows the O and P parameters in the drag law of Eqs. (63) –
(64) as the result of the parametrization with Louis et al. (1982) stability functions and with the M.O. stability func-

tions. The comparison with empirical data shows little difference; the main difference is that the M.O scheme cov-

ers a much larger dimensionless stability range than the Louis et al. scheme for the same range of surface fluxes.

The difference between the two schemes is more obvious in the Figs. 26 and 27 for a downward heat flux of 20

W/m. First of all we sea that the surface stress is much smaller with the M.O. scheme and that the PBL is less deep.

Boundary layer heights with the M.O. scheme are much more realistic and compare much better with data as for

instance expressed by the empirical equilibrium heights proposed by Zilitinkevich (1972) or observations by Nieu-

wstadt (1981).

With a relatively low number of grid points in the PBL, significant discretization errors can be expected. The shal-

low stable boundary layer could be particularly affected as it is only resolved by two or three model levels. The

effect of resolution on the structure of the stable boundary layer is shown in Fig. 28 , where a simulation with the

19-level model resolution is compared to a simulation with three times as many levels. We see that the results are

very similar and that the low resolution simulation is fairly accurate. The unexpected robustness of the numerical

scheme is related to the treatment of the surface layer where a considerable part of the shear and temperature gra-

dients are concentrated. In the surface layer the scheme uses the integral profile functions (94)–(97) as a bulk for-

mulation rather than a finite difference form. It is known from other applications that the integral profile functions

are quite accurate also when extrapolated outside the surface layer (VanWijk et al. 1990).

Concluding remarks

The advantage of ' -closure with local expressions for the diffusion coefficients is that it is fully consistent with the
grid point formulation of the model and that the same scheme can be used for stable, unstable, baroclinic, land, sea

etc. A disadvantage is that a number of model levels are needed to resolve the boundary layer. On the other hand,

it is quite remarkable that the scheme performs fairly well with 2 levels in a shallow stable boundary layer. The

reason is that the surface layer approximation is exact in the sense that the surface layer profile between the surface

and the lowest model level is represented exactly. The resolution is only needed to obtain a reasonable shear stress

profile, but flux profiles are generally fairly linear as function of height and can be represented with a few points

only. Proper resolution is needed however to resolve inversions. Since the position of the inversion is variable, good

resolution is needed trough out the lower troposphere (Beljaars 1991). This is obviously a disadvantage compared

to mixed layer models where a dedicated model variable exists to keep track of the inversion height. Another dis-

advantage is that the closure is local and does not account for the “integral” aspects of e.g. the convective boundary

layer. Although the physics of the convective boundary layer is not well described with local closure, this is not a

real problem in practice because a well mixed layer is always produced when the exchange coefficients are suffi-

ciently large. Local closure has its limitations of course as it does not describe aspects as counter-gradient fluxes,

not well-mixed parameters etc. The main disadvantage of local closure is that it does not describe entrainment at

the top of the mixed layer, because the non-local mechanism of entrainment is not represented at all by a local clo-

sure scheme. With local closure the entrainment rate is generally zero as the local closure produces very small ex-

change coefficients in stable stratification.

In summary we can say the ' -type closure is very realistic for the stable PBL if the resolution is sufficient; also in
the unstable boundary layer, well-mixed quantities are well represented, but entrainment is not modelled at all.

3.4 Y -profile closures
An interesting closure which has been proposed for low resolution models is the ' -profile closure (see Troen and
Mahrt 1986 and Holtslag et al. 1990). The exchange coefficients are not expressed in local gradients but as integral

profiles for the entire PBL. The boundary layer height and the surface fluxes are used as scaling parameters. Also

counter gradient terms are included in the formulation. The exchange coefficients are prescribed as follows for the

stable boundary layer and the unstable surface layer (�/. -  < 0.1):

where is evaluated at the top of the surface layer (�1. - = 0.1). If the stability functions obey free convection
scaling, this closure will automatically provide the usual free convection velocity scale:

(122)

(123)

This closure is again an implicit closure in the sense that the expressions for the fluxes contain the fluxes. In practice

this is solved by treating the surface layer exactly as is done in the local closure scheme. After the surface fluxes

have been computed on the basis of the profiles at the previous time step, the exchange coefficients are specified.

The boundary layer height is an essential part of the parametrization in this scheme and has to be diagnosed. The

following expression is used

(124)

where
� * c is a critical Richardson number with a numerical value of about 0.5, θvs is a virtual temperature some-

where in the surface layer (e.g. 10 m) and θv (h) is the virtual potential temperature at the top of the boundary layer.
For the convective boundary layer the surface temperature is augmented with the temperature excess that the ther-

mals have with respect to their surroundings:

(125)

One of the main advantages of this scheme is that it is extremely robust with respect to numerical stability. The

explicit calculation of the diffusion coefficients in the local ' -closure can introduce stability problems even if the
solution method of the diffusion equation is fully implicit (Kalnay and Kanamitsu 1988; Girard and Delage 1990;

Beljaars 1991). The ' -profile method is much more stable as it does not allow for oscillations in the profile of ex-
change coefficients.

A second advantage is that the non-local aspects of this closure allow for the inclusion of entrainment in the

scheme. However, in the formulation as proposed by Troen and Mahrt, the entrainment is highly dependent on the

details of the numerical formulation and on the vertical resolution.

A disadvantage of the scheme is that it may be difficult to develop generalizations for cloudy and baroclinic bound-

ary layers.

3.5  TKE-closure

The simplest “higher order” closure is the specification of the diffusion coefficients with a prognostic variable for

the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). Many different formulations have been proposed; most of them are “truncat-

ed” versions of full 2nd order closure schemes. A good overview of the different approximations is given by Mellor

and Mellor and Yamada (1974). Implementations in the context of forecast models are discussed by Delage (1974),

Miyakoda and Sirutis (1977), Manton (1983), Thierry and Lacarrerre (1983), Smith (1984) and Dtmenil (1987).

An example of such a closure is the one proposed by Thierry and Lacarrerre (1983):

The parametrization of the planetary boundary layer

Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series

 ECMWF, 2002 51

The purpose of using the TKE equation is to have a prognostic equation for the turbulent velocity scale. A diag-

nostic equation is still needed for the length scales. More advanced models include an equation for the length scale

(Mellor and Yamada 1982) or for the dissipation rate (Detering and Etling 1985, Beljaars et al. 1987, Duynkerke

and Driedonks 1987). Here we limit to diagnostic length scales.

The background of the closure is relatively simple: we replace the unknown terms by dimensionally correct expres-

sions in known model variables. The nature of the expressions is such that they represent the physics of the con-

sidered terms. Finally, adjustable constants are used to obtain a good fit with data. In the example above, the

diffusion coefficients are chosen proportional to a turbulent velocity scale and a turbulent length scale. Both scales

are supposed to represent the large transporting eddies, and the velocity scale is derived from the turbulent kinetic

energy. The length scale is
3 � near the surface, proportional to - (boundary layer height) in neutral and unstable

PBL’s and limited by the Obukhov
�

in very stable flow. The diffusion of TKE is described in the same way as

diffusion of momentum and heat i.e. down-gradient. Dissipation (transformation into heat by viscous forces) takes

place at the smallest turbulent scales which are not modelled at all. The concept of energy cascade is used here

which says that the energy loss at large scales is equal to the dissipation at small scales because no energy can be

lost in the decay of turbulence from large scales to small scales. We therefore can model the dissipation in terms

of large scale velocity and length scales. The amount of energy lost per unit of time on the cascade by the large

eddies is proportional to
$

divide by the eddy turn-over-time . This explains the parametrization of ε in
terms of large eddy characteristics.

The TKE equation includes advection terms, but the turbulence terms have relatively short time scales which makes

that the equation is in quasi-equilibrium most of the time. To simplify the equation, the advection terms can be ne-

glected, whereas the time dependence can be retained simply as a technique to “iterate” the solution towards equi-

librium. The main advantage of TKE closure is that it is the simplest closure with some non-local turbulence

aspects. By means of the diffusion of turbulence from the production area in the mixed layer towards the capping

inversion, this closure is capable of describing entrainment (although not necessarily quantitatively correct). Apart

from this advantage it also enables the introduction of more advanced cloud parametrization schemes Smith 1984;

Duynkerke and Driedonks 1987). It is disappointing, however, that experience so far at ECMWF has indicated that

the scheme is more demanding on vertical resolution. From two different studies (Dtmenil 1987; Manton 1983) it

was concluded that the TKE closure has hardly advantages over the simpler Louis (1979) closure with the resolu-

tion that is available in the PBL with the 19 level ECMWF model. A more fundamental problem with higher order

closure schemes is that these schemes do not necessarily reproduce the surface layer similarity laws. These surface

layer laws are always needed to specify the surface boundary condition at the lowest model level. This may result

in an inconsistency between the lowest model layer and the layers aloft.
