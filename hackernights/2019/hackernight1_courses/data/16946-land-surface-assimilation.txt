Abstract

This lecture note provides a review of techniques recently developed for initialising the prognostic variables of land surface
parametrizations in numerical weather prediction models. The importance of soil moisture initialisation is emphasized since
the evolution of the boundary layer is very sensitive to its specification and the associated time scales are much longer than
those of medium range forecasts. The analysis of snow mass is also described, using the ECMWF method as an illustrative
example. Different methods and data available for the initialisation of other slowly varying components at the surface, such as
soil temperature, vegetation fraction, leaf area index and albedo, are described at the end.

1INTRODUCTION

The importance of land surface processes has been recognised for a long time by the climate modelling community,

in order to describe in a consistent way all the components of the water and energy cycle over long periods of time.

As a consequence a variety of schemes have been devised ranging from the simple bucket model of Manabe (1969)

to the complex soil-vegetation SiB (Simple Biosphere) model of Sellers et al. (1986).

Although a number of sensitivity studies have shown that land surface processes can also affect medium range

weather forecasts (Rind 1982; Rowntree and Bolton 1983; Yeh et al. 1984; Rowell and Blondin 1990; Beljaars et

al. 1996), the parametrization of the interactions between continental surfaces and the lower atmosphere is still

rather crude in most numerical weather prediction models.

Recent field experiments, such as HAPEX-MOBILHY 86, FIFE 87 or BOREAS 94, have enabled the development

and the validation of land surface schemes describing the most important processes governing the water, heat and

momentum exchanges while remaining simple enough to be included in operational weather forecasts models

(Noilhan and Planton 1989; Viterbo and Beljaars 1995). Such parametrizations can improve significantly the qual-

ity of the forecasts of weather elements (Bougeault et al. 1991; Lanzinger 1995). Initialisation of the prognostic

soil variables at global scale is an important issue given the very different time scales of evolution between the at-

mospheric and the soil systems. Realistic schemes appear to be sensitive to the specification of initial soil temper-

atures and water contents (Jacquemin and Noilhan 1990; Bouttier et al. 1993a, 1993b). The increase in realism of

other physical parametrizations (clouds, radiation, convection) in numerical weather prediction models has also

made errors in the surface representation easier to identify. The importance of positive feedbacks between the sur-

face and the atmosphere must be underlined : realistic mechanisms should be represented (which is not possible

when surface boundary conditions are fixed), but spurious ones, resulting from systematic errors in the representa-

tion of some components of the energy and water cycles, should be removed with an appropriate initialisation pro-

cedure.

In the following, we will start in Section 2 by describing the basic features common to most surface schemes. Spe-

cial features of the land surface assimilation are identified in Section 3, in terms of data availability and its relation

to model variables. Section 4 reviews the problems of simple surface initialization procedures. Methods for the in-

itialisation of soil water in numerical models using near-surface temperature and humidity observations are de-

scribed in Section 5, while Section 6 explains the drawbacks of on-site surface observations of soil moisture and

discusses the need for remote sensing. Finally, Section 7 reviews the initialisation of other slowly varying land sur-

face variables, such as snow mass, deep soil temperatures and vegetation characteristics.

2DESIGN OF LAND SURFACE PARAMETRIZATIONS

2.1  General features

The aim of land surface schemes is to compute temperature and specific humidity at the lower boundary of atmos-

pheric models. These two variables are required in the estimation of heat, water and momentum exchanges between

the continental surfaces and the lower atmosphere.

The surface temperature  is derived as the solution of the surface energy balance written as:

(1)

where Rn is the net radiation flux converted in latent heat flux , sensible heat flux and ground heat flux .

The ground heat flux G depends upon deep soil temperatures and soil thermal properties.

The surface specific humidity can be written formally as :

where represents the value of specific humidity at the lowest model layer. The quantities and (described

with more details in the next paragraph) depend upon soil moisture which is obtained by solving the surface

water budget :

(3)

where P is the precipitation flux, E the total evaporation flux and R the surface runoff.

This brief description shows that a land surface scheme must manage at least two prognostic equations for the tem-

perature and soil moisture in the soil. Heat and water transfers are governed by the following diffusion laws :

(4)

(5)

The diffusivity D and conductivity K coefficients are non-linear functions of soil moisture content. The diffusion

equations are generally discretized over 2 to 4 layers in order to deal with time scales ranging from days to months.

2.2  Surface fluxes

The link between soil and atmospheric variables is provided through the expression of the surface fluxes, usually

based on Monin-Obukhov theory; the crucial variable here is the evaporation flux because its magnitude depends

explicitly upon surface properties. Recent land surface schemes represent differently the grid box fractions covered

by: a) bare soil, with evaporation controlled by soil moisture in a shallow top soil layer; b) vegetation, with tran-

spiration controlled by soil moisture in the root zone affecting the magnitude of stomatal resistance; c) snow or

interception reservoir, evaporating at the potential (maximum) rate. These two last components require the exist-

ence of model prognostic equations for snow mass and interception reservoirs.

Evaporation from bare soil can be written as (see Mahfouf and Noilhan 1991 for a review) :

(6)

The efficiency of the turbulent transfers is accounted for through the aerodynamic resistance , while the control

by the surface soil moisture is represented by the surface relative humidity [ and in

Equation (2)]. A typical variation of is presented on the left panel of Fig. 1 . Evaporation takes place at

the potential rate above a threshold value (field capacity)  (defined from soil texture) up to the saturation .

Transpiration from vegetation canopy writes similarly:

root zone to the atmosphere depend both on biological and physical controls. Plants limit their water losses in un-

favorable environmental conditions determined by soil moisture in the root zone, atmospheric water vapour deficit,

solar radiation, air temperature and carbon-dioxide concentration. A typical dependency of the canopy resistance

with soil moisture is shown on the right panel of Fig. 1 . Below a threshold value often defined as the permanent

wilting point , it is assumed that plants are unable to pump water from the root zone to the stomatal cells,

corresponding to a rapid decrease of transpiration (increase in ). As for bare soils, it if often assumed that above

the field capacity the plant transpiration is not controlled by soil moisture.

resistance Rc as a function of the mean volumetric water content (right). (From Mahfouf 1991).

3INTRODUCTION TO LAND SURFACE ASSIMILATION

The major problem of land surface assimilation is the lack of routine observations of soil moisture and soil tem-

perature. This is specially true in the case of soil moisture, where current methods cannot provide global coverage

routinely (see Subsection 6.1 for more details). Furthermore, soil moisture observations show large variability in

small spatial scales (see e.g. Wetzel and Chang 1988); not all scales are of relevance for the atmosphere, and the

assimilation method has to take that into account. For soil temperature the climate network exists, with a coverage

similar to the SYNOP stations and with most of the stations performing observations at least daily; unfortunately,

those observations are not exchanged routinely at the time of measurement, so in practice they can only be used,

in delayed mode, for verification purposes.

The nature and availability of the observations imposes the use of proxy variables for soil moisture. The amount of

water in the root zone impacts on the evaporative fraction, which in itself determines, for a given amount of net

radiation, midday summer screen level temperature and humidity (see previous section and the review by Betts et

al. 1996). On the other hand, the time evolution of soil water depends on the rainfall intensity and on its timing.

Three main types of data have been used in the past to infer soil moisture: (a) Screen level atmospheric temperature

and humidity; (b) Rainfall rates; and (c) Radiometric surface temperature (infrared, microwave). Note that, since

those observations already represent, to a certain extent, the impact of soil moisture on the atmosphere above, they

have already filtered out the smaller scales in soil water.

There are two aditional difficulties in the assimilation of land surface observations. First, these observations are

non-linearly related to soil moisture and soil temperature (through the equations of the land surface scheme). Sec-

ondly, the statistics of forecast errors, used to spatially distribute the local increments in atmospheric analyses, are

not known for soil variables.

4SIMPLE LAND SURFACE INITIALISATION METHODS

Due to the difficulties presented above, soil variables are initialised empirically in most operational forecasts mod-

els.

A first method for initialising soil variables is to set the analysed soil variables to climatological values without

using any model information (through the first-guess). In practice, this is done by adding a relaxation to climatol-

ogy to the prognostic equations of the land surface scheme (Blondin 1991). The underlying idea of this term is that

simple surface schemes can only describe correctly the variables having a short time scale evolution, like the sur-

face soil temperature, and that variables having a time scale longer than a few days must be prescribed. Problems

arise from the specification of climatological soil values which are based on indirect atmospheric observations and

very simplifed transfer models. These products, like the soil moisture climatology of Mintz and Serafini (1992),

have a high level of uncertainty as shown by Viterbo and Beljaars (1995). Another potential problem is that with a

relaxation of deep variables towards climatology, seasonal anomalies cannot be forecasted. An example of such

deficiency has been shown by Beljaars et al. (1996) with two versions of the ECMWF model for the 1993 US

floods.

The other approach to initialise soil variables is to set the analysed values to the first-guess. In that context, an ab-

solute confidence is given to the land surface scheme for evolving its prognostic variables and no control exists to

prevent the land surface scheme from drifting to an unrealistic state. Such drifts can occur through positive feed-

backs with the atmosphere, in situations where the scheme experiences systematic errors in the atmospheric forcing

(too much radiation, too much rainfall, ...) or from a misrepresentation of some land surface processes. The second

point can be checked with stand-alone simulations where the atmospheric forcing is prescribed. An example of a

drift of the current ECMWF land surface scheme within the data assimilation system is described in the next sec-

tion.

5SOIL MOISTURE INITIALISATION USING SYNOP OBSERVATIONS

5.1  The ECMWF method

The land surface scheme developed by Viterbo and Beljaars (1995) was introduced operationally in August 1993

and all soil prognostic variables were initialized to first-guess values. One of the main differences with respect to

the previous ECMWF land surface scheme (Blondin 1991) is the absence of climatological relaxation for deep soil

temperature and water content. During May-June 1994, the soil reservoirs were drying out, leading to surface air

temperature errors increasingly positive, and in comparison with other models, such as the German Weather Serv-

ice (constrained by climatological soil moisture), forecast skill was deteriorating (Viterbo and Courtier 1995). The

downward drift of soil moisture appears to be linked to excess incoming solar radiation primarily caused by under-

prediction of clouds. Furthermore, the excessive warming at the lower troposphere affected the forecast perform-

ance, as shown in Fig. 2 . The 500 hPa geopotential day 2 forecast averaged over Europe is presented for April to

June 1994. The ECMWF forecast (dashed line) has a positive bias from late April onwards.

Figure  2Bias of the 500 hPa geopotential height, averaged over Europe, for the day 2 ECMWF (dashed) and

DWD (solid) forecast.

Analysis increments of specific humidity at the lowest model level during May 1994 show positive values over Eu-

rope with maxima reaching 2.5 g/kg. The atmospheric analysis tries to compensate for the model bias by moisten-

ing and cooling the lower atmosphere. Therefore, the low level humidity increments can be used to identify areas

where the soil is too dry. Knowing the analysis increment of specific humidity , the correction of soil

moisture to be applied the root zone  is assumed to be proportional :

(8)

with ∆ t = 6 hours, and the subscripts a and f refer to analysis and forecast values, repsectively. The relaxation co-
efficient D is constant in space and time and corresponds to a specific humidity analysis increment of 1.5 g/kg fill-

ing 150 mm of water in the soil in 9 days. The fraction of vegetation in the above formula guarantees that the

scheme is not active over deserts. No increments are produced in the presence of snow, and the analysed soil mois-

ture contents θa are limited by the field capacity and permanent wilting point thresholds. The integrated soil water
increments are distributed in each of the three soil layers following the model root extraction. This nudging scheme

was implemented operationally in December 1994. It supplies soil moisture to maintain evaporation in areas of ex-

cessive radiation at the surface, caused, among other factors, by insufficient cloud cover. Fig. 3 compares the day

3 forecast errors in screen level day time temperature and humidity, averaged over Europe. Three experiments are

compared: Operations, FWDC, where no initialisation of soil water is applied and the diagnostic cloud scheme is

used; IWDC, initial soil water method using the technique described above, diagnostic cloud scheme, and; IWPC,

initial soil water method and prognostic cloud scheme. The errors in both temperature and humidity are dramati-

cally reduced when the initialization of soil water is used, and they are reduced even further when the radiation

forcing at the surface is improved by the use of the prognostic cloud scheme. Note that the soil water was reset to

field capacity at 3 July, in a quick effort to correct the large systematic errors in the model; this explains the much

reduced operational errors after that date. The reduction of near surface warm dry bias removes the bias at the trop-

ospheric geopotential, impacting favourably on the root mean square (rms) of the tropospheric geopotential over

Similar techniques are used operationally at Météo-France (Coiffier et al. 1987) and at the Canadian Meteorolog-

ical centre Mailhot et al. 1997). Recently, Yang et al. (1994) have proposed to improve this method by using both

informations of temperature and specific humidity. previous forecast errors with coefficients depending on vegeta-

tion type. Unfortunately the method proposed is biased, because a correction of soil moisture is applied even if the

forecast of atmospheric low level parameters is perfect; this may lead to a long term drift.

experiments the root mean square is computed against the operational analysis.

5.2  Possible improvements

Mahfouf (1991) and Bouttier et al. (1993a, 1993b) have proposed an optimal interpolation scheme for the assimi-

lation of soil moisture using information of both temperature and relative humidity at two metres, which can be

The optimal coefficients α and β minimise the analysis variance and are related to the forecast error statistics. They
are model dependent and the success of the method depends on their accurate estimation. Mahfouf (1991) has used

a Monte-Carlo technique with a one-column model, where soil moisture is perturbed randomly in a range of pos-

sible values. One conclusion of this study is that the coefficients α and β strongly depend upon the diurnal cycle
(information on soil moisture from atmospheric parameters can be extracted more easily during day time in clear

sky conditions) and upon the vegetation cover (over bare soil, corrections are applied to the superficial reservoir

and when the vegetation cover is important soil corrections are applied over the whole root zone). Bouttier et al.

(1993a) proposed a first parametrization of the optimum coefficients, recently generalized by Giard and Bazile

(2000). In order to be used, this initialisation method requires an analysis of temperature and relative humidity at

two metres (Navascues 1997); the analysis increments should be zero in those situations where parameters in the

boundary layer are not informative about soil moisture, e.g. strong advection, and low radiative forcing at the sur-

face.

Once the optimal coefficients are derived, the sequential assimilation can easily be implemented in current opera-

tional data assimilation systems; however, it assumes linear relationships between atmospheric increments and cor-

rections to be applied in the soil which is not a good approximation for most of the physical parametrizations.

Another option is the variational method, which seems a priori more suitable to the analysis of soil moisture due

to the non-linearities of the problem and to the importance of the time distribution of observations (surface varia-

bles are strongly affected by the diurnal cycle). Mahfouf (1991) and more recently Callies et al. (1998) used a 1D-

Var approach to estimate the initial soil moisture of a one-column model that best fit observations of temperature

and relative humidity during a diurnal cycle. The variational method was applied by Rhodin et al. (1999) to a re-

gional weather forecast model over a five-day spring period. The optimal soil moisture minimises the following

cost-function:

(10)

In the above formula , , and , represent, respectively, the screen level temperature and relative hu-

midity, and their assumed observational errors, and the subscripts oi and fi represent the observation i and the fore-

cast value interpolated to the point i; the summation is done over the total number of observation observation points,

N. Mahfouf (1991) has validated the two methods described above with a one-column version of the Météo-France

forecast model using data from the HAPEX-MOBILHY 1986 field experiment. Data from this campaign provided

at various locations simultaneous information about soil moisture content and low-level atmospheric parameters,

i.e. temperature, relative humidity, wind speed. When using observations of temperature and relative humidity, both

the sequential and variational technique converge towards the neutron probe estimates of soil moisture, starting

from arbitrary initial values of soil moisture (Fig. 5 ).

assimilation on 4-5 July 1986. Dotted curves indicate the observed values. The site is HAPEX-MOBILHY. (From

Mahfouf 1991).

Mahfouf (1991) assumed that there is a priori no useful information in the first-guess which is certainly incorrect

with an operational model of some skill; in realistic applications a background term should be added to the cost-

function.

Results show that for clear-sky situations both methods retrieve soil moisture contents close to each other and to

the observations. The variational method is more efficient but non-linearities of the problem make the efficiency of

the convergence dependent on the initial start of the minimisation. When the fraction of vegetation is large, soil

moisture in the root zone is retrieved more accurately than surface soil moisture. The examination of the cost-func-

tion (Fig. 6 ) shows the existence of a secondary minimum (corresponding to ambiguity in the response, the same

surface evaporation can be obtained with totally differents water contents in the soil reservoirs) as well as a plateau

where surface evaporation is not sensitive to modifications in soil moisture (above field capacity, evaporation is as-

sumed to take place at a potential rate, therefore it is no more controlled by the surface).

6OTHER TECHNIQUES TO INITIALISE SOIL MOISTURE

6.1  Methods based on precipitation data

Two methods have been introduced to initialise soil moisture from precipitation data, both of them requiring the

availability of measurements over large areas and an algorithm to perform a precipitation analysis beforehand.

They have only been applied over areas with a good observational coverage like the US or the UK.

The first technique is an uncoupled initialisation where a land surface scheme is forced with conventional meteor-

ological observations (temperature, humidity, wind, radiation and precipitation) to provide an estimate of soil mois-

ture. Feasibility studies have been undertaken in various limited area models by Smith et al. (1994), Macpherson

(1996) and Mitchell (1994). The improvement of the forecasts of screen level humidity when soil water is initial-

ized with such a method, using the UK Met Office water budget scheme, is shown on Fig. 7 (from MacPherson

1996) for all UK stations.

soil moisture: Operational (OP) with free cycling moisture, climatological (CLIM); MORECS (S) and MORECS

(R) refer to a smoothed and raw version, respectively, of the soil moisture initialisation using oberved

precipitation. (From MacPherson 1996).

Another technique makes use of both observed precipitation rates and model first-guess. Assuming a rainfall rate

increment over a 6-hour period:

(11)

This quantity is converted in soil moisture increment by using the tangent linear model of a soil moisture budget

scheme:

(12)

where E is the mean evaporation rate and θ the mean soil moisture content during the 6-hour assimilation period
(trajectory). Then, the soil moisture increment ∆ θ is added to the superficial reservoir. Studies have been under-
taken at ECMWF by Vasiljevic (1989, personal communication) and at UKMO by Jones and Macpherson (1995).

Such a method is sensitive to the specification of surface run-off and can converge slowly when biases in the root

zone are large.

6.2  On-site observations and methods based on satellite imagery

Existing techniques for ground based observations of soil moisture (see recent reviews in Schulin et al. 1992; Wei

1995) are time consuming and normally require human intervention. The representativeness error of the on-site es-

timates is best avoided by deploying several instruments within a relatively small area ( 100 m2), increasing the

cost of the measurements. In spite of its problems, on-site soil moisture data are very useful for regional esimates

for climatic studies, essential to close the water budget in large-scale hydrologic experiments (Cuenca and Noilhan

1991; Goutorbe et al. 1989; Mahfouf 1990) and to calibrate remote sense retrieval techniques (Georgakakos and

Baumer 1996).

There is no prospect of obtaining real-time global estimates of soil moisture based on existing technology of ground

based instruments. For this reason, several algorithms have been developed to infer soil moisture from satellite ob-

servations, although none of them is currently used in an operational data assimilation system. Three types of tech-

niques have been proposed (see reviews in Paloscia 1996; Schulin et al. 1992; Wei 1995) based on infrared

measurements, passive microwave and, more recently, active microwave (radar) instruments.

In the infrared channels, the sensitivity of the diurnal cycle of surface temperature to soil moisture has been used

to define methods based on the observed changes on the infrared skin temperature (which avoid the problem of

absolute calibration of the satellite sensor). For reviews of applications see Carlson (1991), Schmugge and Becker

(1991), and Schulin et al. (1992). Geostationary satellites allow for a better temporal sampling (Wetzel et al. 1984

; McNider et al. 1994). These methods can only be applied in clear sky conditions but provide an information about

soil moisture in the root zone over vegetated areas. Bastianssen (1995) developed recently a technique to estimate

regional evaporation over heterogeneous terrain, based on a separate estimate of the evaporation of unstressed pix-

els, based on potential evaporation, and fully stressed pixels, based on the infrared diurnal cycle technique. The

evaporation of the remaining cloud-free pixels can be obtained by interpolation between the wet pixels and the dry

pixels. van den Hurk et al. (1997) has applied this technique to initialize the soil water of a limited area model over

the Iberian peninsula. The model soil moisture is the linearized solution of a variational problem that minimizes

the difference between model and satellite estimates of evaporative fraction ).

Microwave channels can be used to infer soil moisture due to the important variations of the dielectric constant of

a soil with volumetric water content for frequencies between 1 and 5 GHz (Schmugge and Jackson 1994). Passive

microwave techniques use the fact that soil emissivity changes with its water content. In active microwave sensors

(radar) the signal is emitted by an artificial source and the intensity of the backscattered radiation, after reflection

by the surface, is measured. The reflectivity of the soil changes with its water contents, hence the intensity of the

reflected signal can be related to the soil moisture. Active microwave systems allow, for the same wavelength (same

maximum penetration depth), a finer horizontal resolution, because the ground can be scanned with an angularly

confined beam. One of the drawbacks of microwave retrievals is that the surface emissivity/reflectivity is also sen-

sitive to the surface roughness and the water contents of the vegetation canopy. Nevertheless, it appears that simple

estimates of surface roughness of broad vegetation classes are sufficient to correct the soil moisture estimate (Njoku

and Entekhabi 1996). On the other hand, the oppacity of the vegetation layer increases with its water content, mak-

ing the corrections due to vegetation increasingly unreliable for moist soils. Perhaps the major drawback of micro-

wave estimates is the depth of penetration of the signal, limited to the top layer of the soil (2 to 10 cm, depending

on the wavelength). However, for specific soil hydrological and atmospheric conditions, the soil water contents of

the root layer is correlated with the top soil water. Recent studies show that it is possible to infer, in a physically

consistent way, the whole profile of soil water from its values at the top layer (e.g. Njoku and Entekhabi 1996; Cal-

vet et al. 1997).

We have shown in this section that ground-based estimates of soil moisture, although very important for calibration

purposes and in intensive field efforts, cannot give a near real-time global stimate of soil moisture. Satellite esti-

mates can achieve global coverage, but are limited to clear-sky conditions (infrared channels) or sense only the top

few centimetres of soil (microwave channels). The future relies on physically based estimates of soil moisture from

a combination of satellite measurements and model short-term forecasts, using a variational technique in order to

find the soil water contents that fits best the satellite signal.

The methods used to analyse snow mass are relatively crude when compared to analysis schemes for the atmos-

pheric variables (Lorenc 1986) and could easily be improved. In this section, the ECMWF snow analysis is de-

formula of Verseghy (1991), varying between 188 kg m-3 and 450 kg m-3, is used to convert the snow mass values

1) Snowfall analysis: From SYNOP reports of temperature and precipitation rate, a snowfall rate is

estimated at the observation points, and then a spatial interpolation is done by a successive

correction method.

2) Snow mass background field: A very simple snow model evolution is used to build the background

from the analysed snowfall , the previous analysis of snow mass (persistence) , a snow

climatological mass , and an empirical melting function M based on the 2m temperature

forecast:

(13)

or in a discretized form:

(14)

3) 3) Snow mass analysis: a sucessive correction method is applied to the snow mass increments (the

difference between the background field in (2) and the observations of snow depth, suitably scaled

assuming a fixed snow density of 250 kg m-3).

The main shortcomings are that informations from the model (first-guess) are not taken into account in the analysis

process and that the snow mass climatology, towards which the analysis is relaxed and in fact the dominant term

in data void regions, is rather poor. The snow climatology (Brankovic and van Maanen 1985, BvM85) has been

constructed by running to equilibrium an empirical snow mass model forced by precipitation monthly climate val-

ues and adjusted for melting using a temperature climatology; notice that no snow observations were used and that

the spatial resolution is rather poor ( ). Fig. 8 shows BvM85 climatology for January and April, and com-

pares its values with the US Air Force (USAF) climatology (Foster and Davy 1988), the latter taking into

consideration an extensive collection of regional and global surveys of ground based snow depth observations. Note

that, since the USAF is a climatology of snow depth, BvM85 snow mass values have to be converted using an em-

pirical specification of snow density: Eq (48) of Verseghy (1991), that takes into account the packing of snow under

its own weight, was used. It is clear that in January, the BvM85 values extend too far south in Asia, overestimate

the snow depth in south Siberia, Mongolia and eastern Europe, northwestern and eastern Canada, and underesti-

mate the snow depth in northern Siberia, Iraq, Iran, western Europe and Central Canada. BvM85 values over

Greenland are much larger than USAF, partly because the USAF represents a climatology of seasonal snow depth,

while BvM85 snow mass values have been assigned the arbitrarily high value of 10 m, "to avoid unrealistic melt-

ing" (BvM85). In spring BvM85 overestimates the snow depth virtually everywhere, but for the european values

(e.g. the Alps and Pyrenees), where a small underestimation is detected.

Mean monthly January and April snow depth values of the ECMWF reanalysis are shown in Fig. 9 , together with

their difference to the USAF climatology. The overall patterns in the right panels of Figs. 8 and 9 are very similar,

indicating that the BvM85 climate influences strongly the reanalysis values. Nevertheless, it is also clear that the

information from observations in January is effectively used (values of top panel of Fig. 9 are smaller than the

corresponding values in Fig. 8 ), especially for Europe and western Asia. Substantial errors in the BvM85 clima-

tology in spring lead to large anomalies of the reanalysis mean values. As a further illustration of the reanalysis

information brought by the use of observations, the monthly deviations of snow mass from the BvM85 values is

shown on the left panels of Fig. 10 , while the right panels show the standard deviation of the monthly mean values

of analysed snow mass. Since we are dealing exclusively with snow mass values, there was no need to use the den-

sity relation in this figure. The northeastern Asian values of snow in winter are similar to BvM85, and the standard

deviation is small. A separate analysis (Corti et al. 2000) shows that a very large northern Asian area corresponding

to the former Soviet Union has a data cover very inhomogeneous in time: the number of observations from 1979

to 1992 are 10 to 30 times smaller than in 1993. Values for the month of May (not shown) display larger differences

to the climate and larger variability in northern latitudes. This is due to interannual variability in the rates of melting

implictely used in the snow analysis algorithm (Eq. (14)), and controlled by the first-guess two-metre temperature.

Figure 11Daily snow mass (mm) values from 1 August 1981 to 31 July 1991 for a point over the French Alps (47

N, 6 E, altitude 1100 m). The solid line represents a proxy for the truth, estimated with Martin (1996) model (see

text for more details), the dashed line shows reanalysis values.

The analysis algorithm has been further evaluated by Martin (1996), and results for snow mass are displayed in Fig.

11 . The values of the reanalysis (labelledERA in the picture) are compared with those produced by an off-line

integration of a detailed, physically based snow model, CROCUS (Brun et al. 1989; 1992), forced by ERA values

of screen level temperature, wind speed and humidity, precipation, and semi-empirical derived values for incoming

radiation. The picture shows daily values, from 1 August 1981 to 31 July 1991, for a point in the French Alps (47

N 6 E), where the model elevation is similar to the station height (1100 m). The reanalysis snow mass values cap-

ture well the interannual variability, with maximum values for the years 81/82 and 83/84, and minima for 82/83,

88/89 and 89/90. However, the reanalysis values are systematically too high for the accumulation period, with ERA

overshooting CROCUS values at times. The melting period comes too early, although the reanalysis melting rates

are sometimes similar to values from CROCUS. The snow analysis (step 3 above) requires the specification of a

snow density to convert the observed depth of snow in equivalent water depths (mass values) which are the quan-

tities managed by the land surface scheme. A fixed value of 250 kg m-3 is assumed which appears to be too high

for fresh snow, explaining the overestimation during the accumulation period. In the reanalysis values, the relaxa-

tion coefficient towards the BvM85 climatology is λ = 0.02 which corresponds to a time scale of τ = 12.5 days.
Poor spatial resolution over the Alps might result in lack of data and a relaxation to the underestimated climatolog-

ical values (see bottom right panel of Fig. 8  over the Alps).

Possible improvements of this technique could be to use an updated snow mass climatology based on direct obser-

vations and available at a resolution on 1 degree compatible with the current ECMWF model resolution (Sellers et

al. 1996). The land surface scheme could be improved to provide a more reliable first-guess. With the introduction

of the snow density as a prognostic variable (Douville et al. 1995) it should be possible to perform an analysis in

terms of snow depths, the observed ground-based variable, instead of snow water equivalent (since snowfall can

easily be converted knowing density of fresh snow). Remotely sensed information should be used, since weekly,

and more recently daily, snow cover charts are prepared by NOAA/NESDIS (Bruce Ramsay, personal communi-

cation, see also Sellers et al. 1996) based on a combination of visible, infrared and microwave imagery. Microwave

values could be used to obtain snow mass and snow density, using the dependency of the signal on frequency and

polarization (see review in Hallikainen 1996a; 1996b); the available algorithms are more accurate for dry snow,

and have problems for wet snow or when there are large variations of the roughness in the field of view. The values

of ECMWF analysis of snow mass should be routinely compared with the US Air Force daily analysis of snow

depth, based on ground observations and satellite imagery.

7.2  Deep soil temperatures

Figure  12Soil temperature profiles averaged for a number of stations over northern Germany for 10 April 1997.

The solid (red) line represents the mean observed profile at 14 UTC, the dashed (blue) line represents the

interpolated short-term forecast values verifying at 15 UTC.

Since deep soil temperatures evolve over time scales much longer than short and medium range forecasts, the lack

of initialisation for these variables can lead to potential drifts as the one observed for soil moisture in the ECMWF

model. Experience at ECMWF during the winter 95/96 has shown that this problem can occur in winter, when the

atmospheric forcing over the surface is weaker, and the thermal influence form the soil deeper layers is more im-

portant. The combination of a misrepresentation of some physical processes in the land surface scheme (soil water

freezing), excessive radiative cooling, and insufficient downwards heat transfer in very stable boundary layers led

to excessive cooling of the soil, and large negative biases in screen level temperature. Nevertheless, the problem is

less critical than the summer soil moisture drift since in winter the stable structure of the boundary layer decouples

the atmosphere from the surface below and prevents surface errors from propagating into the mid-troposphere.

Unlike soil moisture, routine measurements of profiles of temperature in the soil are performed by most meteoro-

logical offices. Unfortunately, only very few of these measurements are transmitted in the GTS, and therefore no

global or even continental coverage exists in real time. A handful of european countries sends daily values to EC-

MWF, and those are used regularly for validation and monitoring the model values. An example in Fig. 12 , where

an average profile of soil temperature for stations in northern Germany is compared with the corresponding model

values, for a recent date. The model deep temperatures show a cold bias, but it is interesting to note that the model

gradient is compares well with observations. This might indicate reasonably good soil thermal properties (they de-

termine the vertical gradient), but comparatively poor atmospheric forcing in the previous weeks (determining the

rate of cooling of the whole soil slab). The results are consistent with the well known systematic underestimation

of longwave downward surface radiation of the ECMWF model and other models (Wild et al. 1995; Garratt and

Prata 1996).

The only existing method for initialising soil temperature has been proposed by Coiffier et al. (1987) where ana-

lysed increments at 2 m are reported directly in the soil. This sub-optimal method could be improved by an optimal

interpolation following the methodology of Mahfouf (1991).

7.3  Vegetation properties

Xue et al. (1996) have recently shown that the specification of the seasonal variations of vegetation properties can

have a significant impact on the simulation of monthly mean temperatures near the surface over the North Ameri-

can continent. The sesonal evolution of the vegetation can be of importance over areas with agricultural practices

(mid-latitude continents, tropical regions). Vegetation properties are currently either fixed spatially, as in the EC-

MWF model (Viterbo and Beljaars 1996), or can vary from month to month according to correspondence tables

(Mahfouf et al. 1995). In an operational context, the use of satellite data like Global Vegetation Indexes (GVI) (see

Gutman 1994) could be a better way to capture seasonallity and inter-annual variability of the vegetation. The ma-

jor difficulty is to relate satellite reflectances to input parameters of the land surface scheme (leaf area index,

albedo, vegetation cover,...). However, variational techniques already used for the retrieval of atmospheric vertical

profiles from satellite radiances appear promising (Eyre et al. 1993).

8CONCLUSIONS

During the last five years, the initialisation of prognostic and diagnostic surface variables has been recognised as

an important issue for numerical weather prediction. Weaknesses of initialisations based either on first-guess only

or climatology have been clearly identified. As a consequence, soil moisture is currently initialised in various op-

erational weather centres using sub-optimal analysis methods and observations from SYNOP reports (ECMWF,

UKMO, CMC, Météo-France, HIRLAM). These techniques could be be improved by using analysis methods al-

ready tested for atmospheric variables like optimum interpolation in the sequential framework and 4D-Var (which

is rather appealing by better accounting for the non-linearities of the problem as well as the temporal distribution

of observations).

The other land surface prognostic variables are still crudely initialised. Concerning snow mass analysis at ECMWF,

the current scheme could be improved by using a more recent climatology and a more realistic observation operator

if snow density can be computed by the land surface parametrization.

Areas not yet explored concern the initialisation of deep soil temperatures for which the time scale of evolution is

also much longer than short range forecasts, and the specification of vegetation properties having a seasonal cycle

(such as the albedo, the vegetation cover or the leaf area index). Remote sense data that could be useful in that con-

text include quantities such as satellite skin temperatures or the normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI).

Finally, the examples shown in the paper illustrate the fact that the initialization and parametrization methods have

to be developed together. Realistic models are needed to support indirect measurements techniques, e.g., forecast

snow density allows a better use of snow depth measurements to initialise snow mass. On the other hand, refine-

ments in the land surface parametrization used by numerical models might be needed in order to extract from new

measurement techniques its full information content.
