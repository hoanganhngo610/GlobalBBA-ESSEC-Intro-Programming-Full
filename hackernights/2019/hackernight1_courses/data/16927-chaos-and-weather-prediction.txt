Abstract

The weather is a chaotic system. Small errors in the initial conditions of a forecast grow rapidly, and affect predictability.
Furthermore, predictability is limited by model errors due to the approximate simulation of atmospheric processes of the state-
of-the-art numerical models.

These two sources of uncertainties limit the skill of single, deterministic forecasts in an unpredictable way, with days of high/
poor quality forecasts randomly followed by days of high/poor quality forecasts.

Two of the most recent advances in numerical weather prediction, the operational implementation of ensemble prediction
systems and the development of objective procedures to target adaptive observations are discussed.

Ensemble prediction is a feasible method to integrate a single, deterministic forecast with an estimate of the probability
distribution function of forecast states. In particular, ensemble can provide forecasters with an objective way to predict the skill
of single deterministic forecasts, or, in other words, to forecast the forecast skill. The European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (EPS), based on the notion that initial condition uncertainties are
the dominant source of forecast error, is described.

Adaptive observations targeted in sensitive regions can reduce the initial conditions’ uncertainties, and thus decrease forecast
errors. More generally, singular vectors that identify unstable regions of the atmospheric flow can be used to identify optimal
ways to adapt the atmospheric observing system.

1. INTRODUCTION

A dynamical system shows a chaotic behavior if most orbits exhibit sensitive dependence (Lorenz 1993). An orbit

is characterized by sensitive dependence if most other orbits that pass close to it at some point do not remain close

to it as time advances.

Figure 1. (a)-(c) Forecast for the geopotential height at 1000 hPa (this field illustrates the atmospheric state close

to the surface) given by three forecasts started from very similar initial conditions, and (d) verifying analysis.

Contour interval is 5 m, with only values smaller than 5 m shown.

The atmosphere exhibits this behavior. Fig. 1 shows three different weather forecasts, all started from very similar

initial conditions. The differences among the three initial conditions were smaller than estimated analysis errors,

and each of the three initial conditions could be considered as an equally probable estimate of the “true” initial state

of the atmosphere. After 5 days of numerical integration, the three forecasts evolved into very different atmospheric

situations. In particular, note the different positions of the cyclone forecast in the Eastern Atlantic approaching

United Kingdom (Fig. 1 (a)-(c) ). The first forecast indicated two areas of weak cyclonic circulation west and south

of the British Isles; the second forecast positioned a more intense cyclone southwest of Cornwall, and the third fore-

cast kept the cyclone in the open seas. This latter turned out to be the most accurate when compared to the observed

atmospheric state (Fig. 1 (d). This is a typical example of orbits initially close together and then diverging during

time evolution.

The atmosphere is an intricate dynamical system with many degrees of freedom. The state of the atmosphere is

described by the spatial distribution of wind, temperature, and other weather variables (e.g. specific humidity and

surface pressure). The mathematical differential equations describing the system time evolution include Newton's

laws of motion used in the form ‘acceleration equals force divided by mass’, and the laws of thermodynamics

which describe the behavior of temperature and the other weather variables. Thus, generally speaking, there is a

set of differential equations that describe the weather evolution, at least, in an approximate form.

Richardson (1922) can be considered the first to have shown that the weather could be predicted numerically. In

his work, he approximated the differential equations governing the atmospheric motions with a set of algebraic dif-

ference equations for the tendencies of various field variables at a finite number of grid points in space. By extrap-

olating the computed tendencies ahead in time, he could predict the field variables in the future. Unfortunately, his

results were very poor, both because of deficient initial data, and because of serious problems in his approach.

After World War II the interest in numerical weather prediction revived, partly because of an expansion of the me-

teorological observation network, but also because of the development of digital computers. Charney (1947, 1948)

developed a model applying an essential filtering approximation of the Richardson's equations, based on the so-

called geostrophic and hydrostatic equations. In 1950, an electronic computer (ENIAC) was installed at Princeton

University, and Charney, Fjørtoft and Von Neumann & Ritchmeyer (1950) made the first numerical prediction us-

ing the equivalent barotropic version of Charney’s model. This model provided forecasts of the geopotential height

near 500 hPa, and could be used as an aid to provide explicit predictions of other variables as surface pressure and

temperature distributions. Charney's results led to the developments of more complex models of the atmospheric

circulation, the so-called global circulation models.

With the introduction of powerful computers in meteorology, the meteorological community invested more time

and efforts to develop more complex numerical models of the atmosphere. One of the most complex models used

routinely for operational weather prediction is the one implemented at the European Centre for Medium-Range

Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). At the time of writing (December 1999), its is based on a horizontal spectral trian-

gular truncation T319 with 60 vertical levels formulation (Simmons et al. 1989, Courtier et al. 1991, Simmons et

al. 1995). It includes a parameterization of many physical processes such as surface and boundary layer processes

(Viterbo & Beljaars 1995) radiation (Morcrette 1990), and moist processes (Tiedtke 1993, Jacob 1994).

The starting point, in mathematical terms the initial conditions, of any numerical integration is given by very com-

plex assimilation procedures that estimate the state of the atmosphere by considering all available observations.

The fact that a limited number of observations are available (limited compared to the degrees of freedom of the

system) and that part of the globe is characterized by a very poor coverage introduces uncertainties in the initial

conditions. The presence of uncertainties in the initial conditions is the first source of forecast errors.

A requirement for skilful predictions is that numerical models are able to accurately simulate the dominant atmos-

pheric phenomena. The fact that the description of some physical processes has only a certain degree of accuracy,

and the fact that numerical models simulate only processes with certain spatial and temporal, is the second source

of forecast errors. Computer resources contribute to limit the complexity and the resolution of numerical models

and assimilation, since, to be useful, numerical predictions must be produced in a reasonable amount of time.

These two sources of forecast errors cause weather forecasts to deteriorate with forecast time.

Initial conditions will always be known approximately, since each item of data is characterized by an error that de-

pends on the instrumental accuracy. In other words, small uncertainties related to the characteristics of the atmos-

pheric observing system will always characterize the initial conditions. As a consequence, even if the system

equations were well known, two initial states only slightly differing would depart one from the other very rapidly

as time progresses (Lorenz 1965). Observational errors, usually in the smaller scales, amplify and through non-

linear interactions spread to longer scales, eventually affecting the skill of these latter ones (Somerville 1979).

The error growth of the 10-day forecast of the ECMWF model from 1 December 1980 to 31 May 1994 was ana-

lyzed in great detail by Simmons et al. (1995). It was concluded that 15 years of research had improved substan-

tially the accuracy over the first half of the forecast range (say up to forecast day 5), but that there had been little

error reduction in the late forecast range. While this applied on average, it was also pointed out that there had been

improvements in the skill of the good forecasts. In other words, good forecasts had higher skill in the nineties than

before. The problem was that it was difficult to assess a-priori whether a forecast would be skilful or unskillful us-

ing only a deterministic approach to weather prediction.

Figure 2. The deterministic approach to numerical weather prediction provides one single forecast (blue line) for

the “true” time evolution of the system (red line). The ensemble approach to numerical weather prediction tries to

estimate the probability density function of forecast states (magenta shapes). Ideally, the ensemble probability

density function estimate includes the true state of the system as a possible solution.

Generally speaking, a complete description of the weather prediction problem can be stated in terms of the time

evolution of an appropriate probability density function (PDF) in the atmosphere's phase space (Fig. 2 ). Although

this problem can be formulated exactly through the continuity equation for probability (Liouville equation, see e.g.

Ehrendorfer 1994), ensemble prediction based on a finite number of deterministic integrations appears to be the

only feasible method to predict the PDF beyond the range of linear error growth. Ensemble prediction provided a

way to overcome one of the problems highlighted by Simmons et al. (1995), since it can be used to estimate the

forecast skill of a deterministic forecast, or, in other words, to forecast the forecast skill.

Since December 1992, both the US National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP, previously NMC) and

ECMWF have integrated their deterministic high-resolution prediction with medium-range ensemble prediction

(Tracton & Kalnay 1993, Palmer et al. 1993). These developments followed the theoretical and experimental work

of, among others, Epstein (1969), Gleeson (1970), Fleming (1971a-b) and Leith (1974).

Both centres followed the same strategy of providing an ensemble of forecasts computed with the same model, one

started with unperturbed initial conditions referred to as the “control” forecast and the others with initial conditions

defined adding small perturbations to the control initial condition. Generally speaking, the two ensemble systems

differ in the ensemble size, in the fact that at NCEP a combination of lagged forecasts is used, and in the definition

of the perturbed initial. The reader is referred to Toth & Kalnay (1993) for the description of the 'breeding' method

applied at NMC and to Buizza & Palmer (1995) for a thorough discussion of the singular vector approach followed

at ECMWF.

A different methodology was developed few years later at the Atmospheric Environment Service (Canada), where

a system simulation approach was followed to generate an ensemble of initial perturbations (Houtekamer et al.

1996). A number of parallel data assimilation cycles is run randomly perturbing the observations, and using differ-

ent parameterisation schemes for some physical processes in each run. The ensemble of initial states generated by

the different data assimilation cycles defines the initial conditions of the Canadian ensemble system. Moreover,

forecasts started from such an ensemble of initial conditions are used to estimate forecast-error statistics (Evensen

1994, Houtekamer & Mitchell 1998).

Ensemble prediction, which can be considered one of the most recent advances in numerical weather prediction, is

the first topic discussed in this work. The development of objective procedures to target adaptive observations is

the second topic on which attention will be focused.

The idea of targeting adaptive observations is based on the fact that weather forecasting can be improved by adding

extra observations only in sensitive regions. These sensitive regions can be identified using tangent forward and

adjoint versions of numerical weather prediction models (Thorpe et al. 1998, Buizza & Montani 1999). Once the

sensitive regions have been localised, instruments can be sent to those locations to take the required observations

using pilot-less aircraft, or energy-intensive satellite instruments can be switched on to sample them with greater

accuracy.

After this Introduction, section 2 describes some early results by Lorenz, and illustrates the chaotic behavior of a

simple 3-dimension system. In section 3 the main steps of numerical weather prediction are delineated. The impact

of initial condition and model uncertainties on numerical integration is discussed in section 4. The ECMWF En-

semble Prediction System is described in section 5. Targeting adaptive observations using singular vectors is dis-

cussed in section 6. Some conclusions are reported in section 7. Some mathematical details are reported in two

Appendices.

2. THE LORENZ SYSTEM

One of the fathers of chaos theory is Edward Lorenz (1963, 1965). Results from the 3-dimentional Lorenz system

(1)

illustrate the dispersion of finite time integrations from an ensemble of initial conditions (Fig. 3 ). The different

initial points can be considered as estimates of the “true” state of the system (which can be thought of as any point

inside ellipsoid), and the time evolution of each of them as possible forecasts. Subject to the initial “true” state of

the system, points close together at initial time diverge in time at different rates. Thus, depending on the point cho-

sen to describe the system time evolution, different forecasts are obtained.

The two wings of the Lorenz attractor can be considered as identifying two different weather regimes, for example

one warm and wet and the other cold and sunny. Suppose that the main purpose of the forecast is to predict whether

the system is going through a regime transition. When the system is in a predictable initial state (Fig. 3 (a)), the

rate of forecast diverge is small, and all the points stay close together till the final time. Whatever the point chosen

to represent the initial state of the system, the forecast is characterised by a small error, and a correct indication of

a regime transition is given. The ensemble of points can be used to generate probabilistic forecasts of regime tran-

sitions. In this case, since all points end in the other wing of the attractor, there is a 100% probability of regime

transition.

Figure  3. Lorenz attractor with superimposed finite-time ensemble integration.

By contrast, when the system is in a less predictable state (Fig. 3 (b)), the points stay close together only for a short

time period, and then start diverging. While it is still possible to predict with a good degree of accuracy the future

forecast state of the system for a short time period, it is difficult to predict whether the system will go through a

regime transition in the long forecast range. Fig. 3 (c) shows an even worse scenario, with points diverging even

after a short time period, and ending in very distant part of the system attractor. In probabilistic terms, one could

have only predicted that there is a 50% chance of the system undergoing a regime transition. Moreover, the ensem-

ble of points indicates that there is a greater uncertainty in predicting the region of the system attractor where the

system will be at final time in the third case (Fig. 3 (c)).

The comparison of the points’ divergence during the three cases indicates how ensemble prediction systems can be

used to “forecast the forecast skill”. In the case of the Lorenz system, a small divergence is associated to a predict-

able case, and confidence can be attached to any of the single deterministic forecasts given by the single points. By

contrast, a large diverge indicate low predictability.

Figure  4. ECMWF forecasts for air temperature in London started from (a) 26 June 1995 and (b) 26 June 1994.

Similar sensitivity to the initial state is shown in weather prediction. Fig. 4 shows the forecasts for air temperature

in London given by 33 different forecasts started from very similar initial conditions for two different dates, the

26th of June of 1995 and the 26th of June 1994. There is a clear different degree of divergence during the two cases.

All forecasts stay close together up to forecast day 10 for the first case (Fig. 4 (a)), while they all diverge already

at forecast day 3 in the second case (Fig. 4 (b)). The level of spread among the different forecasts can be used as a

measure of the predictability of the two atmospheric states.

3. NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION

Numerical weather prediction is realised by integrating primitive-equation models. The equations are solved by re-

placing time-derivatives by finite differences, and spatially either by finite difference schemes or spectral methods.

The state of the atmosphere is described at a series of grid-points by a set of state variables such as temperature,

velocity, humidity and pressure.

At the time of writing (December 1999) the ECMWF high-resolution deterministic model has a spectral triangular

truncation TL319, which is equivalent to a grid-point spacing of about 60 km at mid-latitudes (Fig. 5 ) and 60 ver-

tical levels (Fig. 6 ).

Figure  8. Map of radiosonde locations.

Meteorological observations made all over the world (Fig. 7 ) are used to compute the best estimate of the system

initial conditions. Some of these observations, such as the ones from weather balloons or radiosondes, are taken at

specific times at fixed locations (Fig. 8 ). Other data, such as the ones from aircrafts, ships or satellites, are not fixed

in space. Generally speaking, there is a great variability in the density of the observation network. Data over oce-

anic regions, in particular, are characterised by very coarse resolution.

Observations cannot be used directly to start model integration, but must be modified in a dynamically consistent

way to obtain a suitable data set. This process is usually referred to as data assimilation. At the time of writing (De-

cember 1999), ECMWF uses a 4-dimensional data assimilation scheme to estimate the actual state of the atmos-

phere (Courtier et al. 1994).

In the ECMWF model, dynamical quantities as pressure and velocity gradients are evaluated in spectral space,

while computations involving processes such as radiation, moisture conversion, turbulence, are calculated in grid-

point space. This combination preserves the local nature of physical processes, and retains the superior accuracy

of the spectral method for dynamical computation.

The physical processes associated with radiative transfer, turbulent mixing, moist processes, are active at scales

smaller than the horizontal grid size. The approximation of unresolved processes in terms of model-resolved vari-

ables is referred to as parameterisation (Fig. 9 ). The parameterisation of physical processes is probably one of the

most difficult and controversial area of weather modelling (Holton 1992).

4. SOURCES OF FORECAST ERROR

It has been already mentioned that uncertainties in the initial conditions and in the model are both sources of fore-

cast error. Some indications of the relative importance of the two sources can be deduced from the works of Down-

ton & Bell (1988) and Richardson (1998), who compared forecasts given by the UKMO (United Kingdom

Meteorological Office) and the ECMWF forecasting systems. In these studies, substantial forecast differences be-

tween the ECMWF and the UKMO operational forecasts could mostly be traced to differences between the two

operational analyses, rather than between the two forecast models. On the other hand, recent results from Harrison

et al. (1999) indicate that the impact of model uncertainties on forecast error cannot be ignored.

These results suggest that an ensemble system should certainly simulate the presence of uncertainties in the initial

conditions, since this is the dominant effect, but it should also simulate model uncertainties.

The first version of the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System (hereafter EPS, Palmer et al. 1993, Molteni et al.

1996) implemented operationally in December 1992 included only a simulation of initial uncertainties. A similar

“perfect model” strategy was followed at the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, Tracton

& Kalnay 1993).

Houtekamer et al. (1996) first included model uncertainties in the ensemble prediction system developed at the At-

mospheric Environment Service in Canada. Following a system simulation approach to ensemble prediction, they

developed a procedure where each ensemble member differs both in the initial conditions, and in sub-grid scale

parameters. In this approach, each ensemble member is integrated using different parameterizations of horizontal

diffusion, convection, radiation, gravity wave drag, and with different orography.

There are certainly good grounds for believing that there is a significant source of random error associated with the

parameterized physical processes. For example, consider a grid point over the tropical warm pool area during a

period of organized deep convection. By definition, the actual contributions to the tendencies due to parameterized

physical processes are often associated with organized mesoscale convective systems whose spatial extent may be

comparable with the model resolution. In such a case, the notion of a quasi-equilibrium ensemble of sub-grid-scale

processes, upon which all current parameterizations schemes are based, cannot be a fully-appropriate concept for

representing the actual parameterized heating (Palmer 1997). For example, even if the parameterized heating fields

agree on average (i.e. over many time steps) at the chosen grid point, there must inevitably be some standard devi-

ation in the time-step by time-step difference between observed and modeled heating.

Since October 1998, a simple stochastic scheme for simulating random model errors due to parameterized physical

processes has been used in the ECMWF EPS (Buizza et al. 1999). The scheme is based on the notion that the sort

of random error in parameterized forcing are coherent between the different parameterization modules, and have

certain coherence on the space and time scales associated, for example, with organized convection schemes. More-

over, the scheme assumes that the larger the parameterized tendencies, the larger the random error component will

be. The notion of coherence between modules allows the stochastic perturbation to be based on the total tendency

from all parameterized processes, rather than on the parameterized tendencies from each of the individual modules.

In this respect the ECMWF scheme differs conceptually from that of Houtekamer et al. (1996). More details about

the scheme are reported in the following section.

5. THE ECMWF ENSEMBLE PREDICTION SYSTEM

Routine real-time execution of the ECMWF EPS started in December 1992 with a 31-member T63L19 configura-

tion (spectral triangular truncation T63 and 19 vertical levels, Palmer et al. 1993, Molteni et al. 1996). A major

upgrade to a 51-member TL159L31 system (spectral triangular truncation T159 with linear grid) took place in 1996

(Buizza et al. 1998). A scheme to simulate model uncertainties due to random model error in the parameterized

physical processes was introduced in 1998.

The singular vectors of the tangent forward propagator sample the phase space directions of maximum growth dur-

ing a 48-hour time interval. Small errors in the initial conditions along these directions would amplify most rapidly,

and affect the forecast accuracy. The reader is referred to Appendix A for a more complete mathematical definition

of the singular vectors.

Fig. 10 illustrates the typical structure of the leading singular vector used to generate the ensemble of initial per-

turbations for 17 January 1997. Total energy singular vectors are usually located in the lower troposphere at initial

time, with total energy peaking at between around 700 hPa (i.e. around 3000 m), in regions of strong barotropic

and baroclinic energy conversion (Buizza & Palmer 1995). During their growth, they show an upscale energy trans-

fer and upward energy propagation. Results have indicated a very good agreement between the regions where sin-

gular vectors are located and other measures of baroclinic instability such as the Eady index introduced by Hoskins

& Valdes (1990). This is shown in Fig. 11 for the case of 17 January 1997. The reader is referred to Hoskins et al.

(1999) for recent investigations on singular vector growth mechanisms.

negative and shaded yellow/red for positive values) and the atmospheric state (geopotential height) at 500 hPa (i.e.

Contour interval is 8 dam for geopotential height, and 0.2 degrees for temperature at initial time and 1.0 degree at

final time.

Figure 11. Eady index (top panel) and location of the leading singular vectors identified by the root-mean-square

amplitude of the EPS perturbations at forecast day 1 (bottom panel) for the case of 17 January 1997. Contour

interval is 1 day-1 for the Eady index, and 1 m for the EPS perturbation amplitude.

Until 26 March 1998, the EPS initial perturbations were computed to sample instabilities growing in the forecast

range, and no account was taken of perturbations that had grown during the data assimilation cycle leading up to

the generation of the initial conditions (Molteni et al. 1996).

A way to overcome this problem is to use singular vectors growing in the past, and evolved to the current time.

The 50 perturbed initial conditions were generated by adding and subtracting 25 perturbations defined using 25

singular vectors selected from computed singular vectors so that they do not overlap in space. The selection criteria

were that the leading 4 singular vectors are always selected, and that subsequent singular vectors are selected only

if less than 50% of their total energy cover a geographical region where already 4 singular vectors are located.

Once the 25 singular vectors were selected, an orthogonal rotation in phase-space and a final re-scaling were per-

formed to construct the ensemble perturbations. The purpose of the phase-space rotation is to generate perturba-

tions with the same globally averaged energy as the singular vectors, but smaller local maxima and a more uniform

spatial distribution. Moreover, unlike the singular vectors, the rotated singular vectors are characterized by similar

amplification rates (at least up to 48 hours). Thus, the rotated singular vectors diverge, on average, equally from

the control forecast. The rotation is defined to minimize the local ratio between the perturbation amplitude and the

amplitude of the analysis error estimate given by the ECMWF data assimilation procedure. The re-scaling allowed

perturbations to have local maxima up to  larger than the local maxima of the analysis error estimate.

A way to take into account perturbations growing during the data assimilation period was to generate the EPS initial

perturbation using two sets of singular vectors. In mathematical terms, since 26 March 1998 (Barkmeijer et al.

1999a) the day initial perturbations have been generated using both the singular vectors growing in the forecast

range between day and day at initial time, and the singular vectors that had grown in the past between

day  and day  at final time

where is the i-th singular vector growing between day d and d+2 at time t=0. The coefficients ai,j

and bi,j set the initial amplitude of the ensemble perturbations, and are defined by comparing the singular vectors

with estimates of analysis errors (Molteni et al. 1996). Since 26 March 1998, the selection criteria has been kept

as before, but a new scaling factor  has been used.

The initial perturbations are specified in terms of the spectral coefficients of the 3-dimensional vorticity, divergence

and temperature fields (no perturbations are defined for the specific humidity since the singular vector computation

is performed with a dry linear forward/adjoint model), and of the 2-dimensional surface pressure field. They are

added and subtracted to the control initial conditions to define perturbed initial conditions. Then, 50 + 1 (control)

10-day TL159L31 non-linear integrations are performed.

With the current ECMWF computer facilities, each day the whole EPS (10-day integration, 51 members at

TL159L40 with T42L40 singular vectors computed for the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres) takes approx-

imately 150 hours of total computing time (about 10% of this time is used to compute the initial perturbations). By

contrast, the high resolution TL319L60 deterministic forecast (10-day integration) takes about 40 hours, and the

data assimilation procedure used to generate the unperturbed initial conditions takes about 120 hours (4 cycles per

day, once every 6 hours).

5.2  The new EPS configuration

In October 1998, a scheme to simulate random model errors due to parameterized physical processed was intro-

duced (Buizza et al. 1999). This scheme can be considered as a simple first attempt to simulated random model

errors due to parametrized physical processes. It is based on the notion that random errors due to parametrized

physical processes are coherent between the different parametrization modules and have a certain coherence on the

space and time scales represented by the model. The scheme assumes that the larger the parametrized tendencies,

the larger the random error component.

In the new EPS, each ensemble member  can be seen as the time integration

(6)

of the perturbed model equations

starting from the perturbed initial conditions defined in Eq. (1), where and identify the contribution to the

full equation tendency of the non-parameterized and parameterized physical processes. For each grid point

(identified by its latitude, longitude and vertical hybrid coordinate), the perturbed parameterized

tendency (of each state vector component) is defined as

where is the unperturbed diabatic tendency, and indicates that the same random number has been

used for all grid points inside a  degree box and over  time steps.

The notion of space-time coherence assumes that organized systems have some intrinsic space and time-scales that

may span more than one model time step and more than one model grid point. Making the stochastic uncertainty

proportional to the tendency is based on the concept that organization (away from the notion of a quasi-equilibrium

ensemble of sub-grid processes) is likely to be stronger, the stronger is the parameterized contribution. A certain

space-time correlation is introduced in order to have tendency perturbations with the same spatial and time scales

as observed organization.

panel shows the case of no spatial scale, in other words when different random numbers are used at each grid-

point. The bottom panel shows the case when the same random number was used for grid-points inside 5-degree

boxes. Blue crosses identify grid-points with random numbers , green diamonds points with

tic physics scheme. Fig. 12 (a) shows the matrix of random numbers when each grid-point was assigned an in-

dependent value, while Fig. 12 (b) shows the matrix when the same random number was used inside 5 degree

After an extensive experimentation, it was decided to implement in the operational EPS the stochastic physics

scheme with random numbers sampled uniformly in the interval , a 10 degrees box size ( ), and

a 6 hours time interval ( ).

6. TARGETED OBSERVATIONS

Consider a meteorological system evolving between time and , localised at final time inside a geographical

area (hereafter verification area). Suppose that extra observations could be taken inside a geographical area

at initial time  (hereafter target area), with the purpose of improving the time  forecast inside .

Singular vectors with maximum energy at final time inside a verification area can be used to identify the target area

where extra observation should be taken, at initial time, to reduce the forecast error inside the verification area itself

(Buizza & Montani 1999). The reader is referred to Appendices A and B for a more complete description of the

mathematical formulation.

Other strategies can be used to target adaptive observations. Langland & Rohaly (1996), following the work of Ra-

bier et al. (1996) on sensitivity vectors, proposed to use the lower tropospheric vorticity of the forecast state as cost

function, and to target the region where the sensitivity field is maximum. A similar technique, but based on the use

of a quasi-inverse linear model, was proposed by Pu et al. (1997, 1998). Bishop & Toth (1998) introduced the En-

semble Transform technique, in which linear combinations of ensemble perturbations are used to estimate the pre-

diction error variance associated with different possible deployments of observational resources. Finally, following

Hoskins et al. (1985) and Appenzeller et al. (1996), a more subjective strategy based on the use of potential vorti-

city to analyse atmospheric was also developed.

All these techniques were applied to target observations for the first time during FASTEX, the Fronts and Atlantic

Storm Track Experiment (Joly et al. 1996, Thorpe & Shapiro 1995, Snyder 1996).

The focus of the FASTEX campaign was the extra-tropical cylonic storms that form over the western and mid At-

lantic Ocean, and take about 2 days to develop and move towards Europe. Forecast failures are often associated

with these very active atmospheric phenomena.

Fig. 13 shows the tracks of one of the storms observed during FASTEX, IOP 17 (IOP stands for Intensive Obser-

vation Period), and the location of various aircrafts that made additional observations between 17 and 19 February

1997 (Montani et al. 1999). Singular vectors, computed to have maximum total energy inside a verification region

centred on the British Isles, were used to identify the most sensitive regions where observations were made. The

comparison of the central pressure of two forecasts, one started from initial conditions computed with and one

without the extra observations, with the observed value (Fig. 14 ) indicates that additional, targeted observations

can improve the forecast accuracy. Fig. 15 shows the average impact of the targeted observations on the forecast

error. Results indicated up to 20% forecast error reduction.

the 500 and 1000 hPa geopotential height fields over Europe and North Atlantic at forecast day 2, 2.5 and 3 (from

Montani et al. 1999).

Following the FASTEX campaign, other experiments were performed (e.g. NORPEX, the North Pacific Experi-

ment, CALJET, the California Land-falling Jets experiments). All results confirmed that taking extra observations

in sensitive regions could reduce forecast errors.

Robotic aerosondes capable of long-range monitoring could be used operationally in a very near future to fill chron-

ic gaps in the global upper-air sounding network (Holland et al. 1992), and take extra observations in objectively

identified regions. This follows years of intensive research at the Bureau of Meteorology of Melbourne, Australia,

that culminated with the first-ever unmanned aircraft crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in August 1998 (http://

www.aerosonde.com/opshist.htm).

7. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Two of the most important advances in numerical weather prediction of the last 10 years, the operational imple-

mentation of ensemble prediction systems and the development of objective techniques to target adaptive observa-

tions, have been discussed.

Ensemble systems provide a possible way to estimate the probability distribution function of forecast states. They

have been developed following the notion that uncertainties in the initial conditions and in the model formulation

are the main sources of forecast errors. Results have demonstrated that a probabilistic approach to weather predic-

tion can provide more information than a deterministic approach based on a single, deterministic forecast.

Ensemble prediction systems are particularly useful, if not necessary, to provide early warnings of extreme weather

events. For example, ensemble systems can be used to predict probabilities of intense precipitation events (Fig. 16

). Global ensemble systems can be used to provide boundary and initial conditions for higher-resolution, limited

area ensemble prediction systems (Molteni et al. 1999, Marsigli et al. 1999).

At ECMWF, work is in progress in many different areas to further improve the current ensemble prediction system.

Linearized versions of the most important physical processes have been developed (Mahfouf 1999), and investiga-

tion into the behaviour of the linear models in the computation of tropical singular vectors has started. The tropical

target area has been chosen because the current EPS lacks perturbations of the initial condition in this area, where

moist processes are of key importance. Results (Barkmeijer et al. 1999b, Puri et al. 1999) indicate that the inclusion

of tropical singular vectors is essential in cases of hurricane prediction. Results indicate that tropical singular vec-

tors are needed to generate a realistic spread among the ensemble of hurricane tracks.

The operational initial perturbations of the ECMWF EPS are constructed using singular vectors with maximum

total energy growth. Total energy singular vectors have no knowledge of analysis error statistics. Generally speak-

ing, it would be desirable to use information about analysis error characteristics in the singular vector computation.

One way of improving upon this is to use in the singular vector computation statistics generated by the data assim-

ilation system. Work is in progress to use the Hessian of the cost function of the 3-dimensional (or 4-dimensional)

variational assimilation system (3D/4D-Var) to define singular vectors (Barkmeijer et al. 1998). These so-called

Hessian singular vectors are constrained at initial time by analysis error statistics but still produce fast perturbation

growth during the first few days of the forecast.

Work is in progress to investigate whether a so-called consensus analysis, defined as the average of analyses pro-

duced by different weather centres, is a better estimate of the atmospheric initial state than the ECMWF analysis

(Richardson, 1999, personal communication). The operational EPS configuration has been run from the consensus

analysis, average of the ECMWF, UKMO (UK Meteorological Office), Météo-France, NCEP (National Centers

for Environmental Prediction, Washington) and DWD (Deutscher WetterDienst, Offenbach) analyses. The same

perturbations as used in the operational EPS have been added to the consensus analysis to create the 50 perturbed

initial conditions. Preliminary results show that the skill of the control forecast is improved if the consensus anal-

ysis is used instead of the ECMWF analysis as the unperturbed initial condition. Results also indicate that the dif-

ference between the spread in the two systems is rather small, while the ensemble-mean forecast of the system

started from the consensus analysis is more skilful.

Experimentation has started to verify whether a resolution increase from Tl159 to Tl255, and from 31 to 60 vertical

levels would improve the EPS performance. Preliminary studies of the impact of an increase in horizontal resolu-

tion indicate that precipitation prediction improves substantially as resolution increases.

Finally, an ensemble approach to data assimilation is under test. Following Houtekamer et al. (1996), but with the

ECMWF approach to represent model uncertainties, work has started at ECMWF to generate an ensemble of initial

perturbations using the ECMWF 3D/4D-Var data assimilation. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether

a better estimate of the “true” state of the atmosphere can be computed using this probabilistic approach.

8. CONCLUSION

The weather is a chaotic system, and numerical weather prediction is a very difficult task.

This work has demonstrated that the application of linear algebra (i.e. the use of singular vectors computed by solv-

ing an eigenvalue problem defined by the tangent forward and adjoint versions of the model) to meteorology can

help in designing new ways to numerical weather prediction (Buizza 1997).

The same technique can be applied to any dynamical system, in particular to very complex systems with a large

dimension. The basic idea is that there are only few, important directions of the phase-space of any system along

which the most important processes occur. A successful prediction of the system time evolution should sample

these directions, and describe the system evolution along them.

APPENDIX A SINGULAR VECTOR DEFINITION

Farrell (1982), studying the growth of perturbations in baroclinic flows, showed that, although the long time as-

ymptotic behavior is dominated by discrete exponentially growing normal modes when they exist, physically real-

istic perturbations could present, for some finite time intervals, amplification rates greater than the most unstable

normal mode amplification rate. Subsequently, Farrell (1988, 1989) showed that perturbations with the fastest

growth over a finite time interval could be identified solving the eigenvalue problem of the product of the tangent

forward and adjoint model propagators. His results supported earlier conclusions by Lorenz (1965) that perturba-

tion growth in realistic models is related to the eigenvalues of the operator product.

Kontarev (1980) and Hall and Cacuci (1983) first used the adjoint of a dynamical model for sensitivity studies.

Later on, Le Dimet & Talagrand (1986) proposed an algorithm, based on an appropriate use of an adjoint dynamical

equation, for solving constraint minimization problems in the context of analysis and assimilation of meteorolog-

ical observations. More recently, Lacarra & Talagrand (1988) applied the adjoint technique to determine optimal

perturbations using a simple numerical model. Following Urban (1985) they used a Lanczos algorithm (Strang,

1986) in order to solve the related eigenvalue problem. For a bibliography in chronological order of published

works in meteorology dealing with adjoints up to the end of 1992, the reader is referred to Courtier et al. (1993).

After Farrell and Lorenz, calculations of perturbations growing over finite-time intervals were performed, for ex-

ample, by Borges & Hartmann (1992) using a barotropic model, and by Molteni & Palmer (1993) using a barotrop-

ic and a 3-level quasi-geostrophic model at spectral triangular truncation T21. Buizza (1992) and Buizza et al.

(1993) first identified singular vectors in a primitive equation model with a large number of degrees of freedom.

Let  be the state vector of a generic autonomous system, whose evolution equations can be formally written as

Denote by an integration of Eq. (9) from to , which generates a trajectory from an initial point to

From Eqs. (11) and (16) it follows that the squared norm of a perturbation  at time  is given by

(17)

Equation (17) shows that the problem of finding the phase space directions for which is

maximum can be reduced to the search of the eigenvectors

(18)

with the largest eigenvalues .

The square roots of the eigenvalues, , are called the singular values and the eigenvectors the (right) sin-

gular vectors of with respect to the inner product (see, e.g., Noble & Daniel, 1977). The singular vectors with

largest singular values identify the directions characterized by maximum growth. The time interval is called

optimization time interval.

Unlike itself, the operator is normal. Hence, its eigenvectors can be chosen to form a complete

orthonormal basis in the -dimensional tangent space of the perturbations at . Moreover, the eigenvalues

are real, .

At optimization time , the singular vectors evolve to

(19)

which in turn satisfy the eigenvector equation

(20)

From Eqs. (17) and (20) it follows that

(21)

Since any perturbation can be written as a linear combination of the singular vectors , it follows

that

(22)

Thus, maximum growth as measured by the norm  is associated with the dominant singular vector  .

Given the tangent forward propagator , it is evident from Eq. (18) that singular vectors' characteristics depend

strongly on the inner product definition and to the specification of the optimization time interval.

The problem can be generalized by selecting a different inner product at initial and optimization time. Consider

two inner products defined by the (positive definite Hermitian) matrices and , and re-state the problem as

is maximum. Applying the transformation , the right hand side ofEq. (18) can be transformed into

(24)

Since

(25)

the phase space directions which maximize the ratio in Eq. (24) are the singular vectors of the operator

with respect to the canonical Euclidean inner product. With this definition, the dependence of the

singular vectors' characteristics on the inner products is made explicit.

At ECMWF, due to the very large dimension of the system, the eigenvalue problem that defines the singular vectors

is solved by applying a Lanczos code (Glub & Van Loan 1983).

APPENDIX B PROJECTION OPERATORS

The set of differential equations that defines the system evolution can be solved numerically with different meth-

ods. For example, they can be solved with spectral methods, by expanding a state vector onto a suitable basis of

functions, or with finite-difference methods in which the derivatives in the differential equation of motions are re-

placed by finite difference approximations at a discrete set of grid points in space. The ECMWF primitive equation

model solves the system evolution equations partly in spectral space, and partly in grid point space.

Denote by the grid point representation of the state vector , by the spectral-to-grid point transformation

operator, , and by the multiplication of the vector , defined in grid-point space, by the function

:

(26)

where  defines the coordinate of a grid point, and  is a geographical region.

Define the function  in spectral space as

(27)

where  identifies a wave number and  is a sub-space of the spectral space.

Consider a vector . The application of the local projection operator  defined as

to the vector sets the vector to zero for all grid points outside the geographical region . Similarly, the appli-

cation of the spectral projection operator to the vector sets to zero its spectral components with wave number

outside .

The projection operators and can be used either at initial or at final time, or at both times. As an example,

these operators can be used to formulate the following problem: find the perturbations with (i) the fastest growth

during the time interval , (ii) unitary -norm and wave components belonging to at initial time, (iii)

maximum -norm inside the geographical region and wave components belonging to at optimization time.

This problem can be solved by the computation of the singular values of the operator
