1. INTRODUCTION

The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter modifies to some extent the incident wave. The medium

therefore produces a signature in the amplitude, phase or spectral composition which depends on composition and

structure of the medium. The basic principle associated with remote sensing of the atmospheric temperature and

humidity structure involves the interpretation of radiometric measurements of electromagnetic radiation in specific

spectral intervals which are sensitive to some physical aspects of the medium. More specifically, at any wavenum-

ber (or wavelength) in the infrared or microwave regions where an atmospheric constituent absorbs radiation, it

also emits thermal radiation according to Kirchhoff's Law. Since the radiance leaving the atmosphere is a function

of the distribution of the emitting gases and of temperature throughout the atmosphere, measurements of radiance

contain some information on both these quantities.

These lectures will start with an introduction to the basic radiometric quantities and laws to be used, then will derive

and discuss the equation of radiative transfer for an absorbing and emitting medium. No scattering is included so

the results will be applicable only to situations in which scattering phenomena play a secondary role, as is the case

for the energy transfer in the clear atmosphere in the infrared and at microwave frequencies, provided no clouds

are involved in which precipitation is taking place nor ice phase is present. The concepts outlined below are de-

scribed in more detail in Goody and Yung (1989) to which the interested reader is referred.

2. ABSORPTION AND TRANSMISSION OF MONOCHROMATIC RADIATION

Referring to Fig. 1 , radiance is the amount of energy crossing, in a time interval and in the wavenumber interval

to , a differential area at an angle to the normal to , the beam being confined to a solid angle

. In other words

and the unit is W(m2 sr cm-1)-1.

Sometimes different units are used, like mW(m2 sr cm-1)-1 whose numerical values are the same as in CGS units.

Radiance can also be defined for a unit wavelength or frequency interval (in units of inverse centimetres) the

relation among these quantities being

where is the speed of light in vacuum and is frequency (in units of Hz). Spectroscopists have adopted the wav-

enumber as the normal unit for frequency and this is used throughout this report. However at microwave frequen-

cies the true frequency (in GHz) is often employed.

Whenever a beam of monochromatic radiation, whose radiance is enters an absorbing medium (see Fig. 2 ),

the fractional decrease experienced is:

where is the density of the medium at and is a proportionality factor called the (spectral) absorp-

tion coefficient. Integrating Eq. (2) between 0 and  yields

(3)

where is the boundary value, i.e. the radiance entering the medium at . The ratio is

called the (spectral) transmittance of the Black Body radiation medium.and is the optical depth. An

example of the use of Eq. (3) is the modelling of attenuation of the solar direct beam due to atmospheric constitu-

ents. The real problem lies, as always, in the knowledge of  the absorption coefficient of the gases.

quency emitted by a blackbody at temperature is expressed by

Equation (4) implies that, as long as a cavity is in thermodynamic equilibrium (TE) at a given temperature, the spec-

tral distribution of radiance emitted by the cavity depends only on its temperature, whatever spectral distribution

of radiance is entering the cavity. This is because quanta entering a perfect black cavity undergo a succession of

internal reflections and absorptions until all the energy is absorbed within the cavity.

4. EMISSIVITY, KIRCHHOFF LAW AND LOCAL THERMODYNAMICAL EQUILIBRIUM.

In general a medium that absorbs radiation may also emit radiation at the same wavenumber. If we enclose the vol-

ume of gas in Fig. 2 in a black box in thermodynamic (TE) with the gas, the temperature of its walls being the

same as that of the gas, then the radiance emitted from the walls of the box in all directions will be and the

amount of energy absorbed in the any direction (say for convenience) by a layer deep of gas is

.

each curve (taken from Valley, 1965).

The same amount of gas will emit in the -direction an amount of energy where is a proportion-

ality constant called the (spectral) emissivity of the gas. Now the amount of emitted energy must be equal to the

amount of energy absorbed in the same direction, for equilibrium conditions; otherwise equilibrium would not be

possible and the second law of thermodynamics would be violated. This in turn implies the equality of the absorp-

tion and emission coefficients when TE is achieved, which is a way of stating Kirchhoff’s Law.

The radiation field of the earth atmosphere, as a whole, is not in TE. However, below about 40 to 60 km, a volume

of gas behaves approximately as a black cavity so that the emission from the volume is dependent only on its tem-

perature, whatever the spectral distribution of radiance entering the volume from outside may be. In fact, as soon

as a molecule absorbs a quantum of energy, some is lost by collisional exchange with nearby molecules, before

emission takes place. These collision exchanges spread the energy of the initial quantum throughout the volume of

air. When emission finally occurs, it takes place from an upper energy level which is lower than the level reached

after the initial absorption. When the mean time between collisions (relaxation time) is much smaller than the time

interval between the initial absorption and final emission (natural lifetime), then a single kinetic temperature char-

acterizes, to a good approximation, the gas. This (lucky) circumstance is denoted by the term Local Thermodynam-

ic Equilibrium. At STP the ratio of relaxation time to natural lifetime is about 10-10 for a rotational transition and

 for a vibrational transition.

5. THE EQUATION FOR RADIATIVE TRANSFER

Consider the volume of gas in Fig. 2 in which emission as well as absorption now takes place, but not scattering.

The equation of energy transfer can be written, for monochromatic radiation,

where the -direction is the direction of propagation of the incident wave, can now take values from 0 to .

The first term on the right-hand side is the effect of absorption within , and is the source of radiant

emission within . We are interested in computing the value of radiance at . Dropping for simplicity the

subscript  and applying the Kirchhoff law we get:

(6)

where is the temperature of the gas at . We define the monochromatic optical depth of the medium

between points  and  as

(7)

Equation (6) can then be written

we can multiply Eq. (8) by  and then integrate the resultant equation between 0 and

to obtain finally

(9)

The first term on right-hand side of (9) is analogous to the one in Eq. (3) and represents the radiance at the boundary

multiplied by the transmittance from the boundary up to . The second term is the contribution due to emission

from the medium in the direction of the incident wave. Each slab around a generic point radiates depending

on the amount of gas ( ) on its emissivity ( ) and on its temperature. The energy is depleted in its way

from  to  by a factor given by the transmittance from to

A similar equation is obtained when computing the radiance emitted by the atmosphere in any upward direction

toward space. Denoting by the zenith axis ( represents the top of the atmosphere) and by the zenith angle

of the emitted radiation the solution is (dropping the spectral index):

The term  is the increase of optical depth with zenith angle for a plane parallel atmosphere.

One may note that

Equation (10) can also be expressed using pressure, or , as vertical coordinate. Examples can be found in Sec-

tion 10.

6. SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION OF RADIANCE LEAVING THE ATMOSPHERE

Radiance, defined in Section 2, can be expressed in terms of the temperature that a perfect black body would have

to emit the same radiance in the same wavenumber interval. The latter quantity is referred to as brightness temper-

ature ( ).

Figure 5 shows simulated upward radiance at 56 hPa height for a mid-latitude temperature and moisture profile.

Fig. 6 shows the same data converted to . The spectral resolution (see section 10 for the definition) of the two

data set is .It may be noticed that a constant corresponds to diminishing values of radiance as we

move to higher wavenumbers since the maximum value for the Planck function at 300 K is around 600 cm-1.

Recalling that low values of are associated with low numeric values of radiances, it appears that some complex

interaction is taking place within the atmosphere producing large variations in energy emitted upwards. An expla-

nation for this requires some knowledge of basic spectroscopy, the principles of which will be dealt with in the next

section. It will be shown that the presence of sharp variations in brightness temperature (or radiance, or absorption

properties) is due to the nature of the interaction which is quantized.

7. MODELLING THE INTERACTION

For interaction to take place a force must act on a molecule in the presence of an external electromagnetic field.

The existence of such a force depends on the presence of an electric or magnetic instantaneous dipole moment. The

polarizability of a molecule is related to the extent to which a molecule has a permanent dipole moment or can

acquire an oscillating one produced by its vibrational motion. If we consider a molecule as a rigid rotator, radiative

interaction can take place only if the molecules possess a permanent dipole moment. Thus CO, N2O, H2O and O3
(see Fig. 8 ) interact with the field by changing their “rotation vector” while N2, O2, CO2 and CH4 do not. However

as a molecule like CO2 vibrates, an oscillating electrical dipole moment is produced and rotational interaction can

take place. Hence CO2 and CH4 possess vibration-rotational couplings with the incident wave.

In what follows only interaction through electric dipole moments will be considered, the main aim of this section

being to show some examples of how molecular absorption and emission spectra can be explained (and computed).

7.1  The molecule as a rigid quantized rotator.

Diatomic or linear triatomic molecule (Fig. 10 ) have two equal moments of inertia and two degrees of rotational

freedom. Asymmetric top molecules, like H2O have three unequal moments of inertia and three degrees of free-

dom.

The kinetic energy of a rigid rotator is . While for a classical rotator and hence can

take any value, a quantized rotator is subject to quantum restrictions on angular momentum

where , the quantum number for rotation, can assume only integer values. The quantized rotational energy can

therefore be written

Recalling that is the rotational energy associated to a rotational state around a specific principal axis and

calling rotational constant the quantity

where  is the moment of inertia around that axis, we may write

For asymmetric top molecules we will have three moments of inertia and three rotational constants

(namely ,  and ). The rotational energy can be expressed in terms of the rotational term

which is measured in the energy unit cm-1. is the rotational constant associated to the axis with moment of inertia

. In Table 1 values of the molecular electrical dipole and rotational constants for some of the most important

A quantum selection rule dictates that only transition among adjacent levels are allowed, that is

where the value applies to absorption, which increases the internal energy of the molecule. Hence for the

case of absorption

(11)

The absorbed photons have energies that are individually equal to Eq. (11) and the aggregate effect from all the

molecules in a volume is a depletion of the incident wave energy at wavenumber which is observed as a spec-

tral line. As an example absorption of a photon at wavenumber 669.29 (corresponding to the wavelength 14.947

) is accomplished by the H2O molecule spinning around its principal axis A with a transition from rotational

quantum number 12 to 13.

The absorption by a volume of gas will result in the depletion of radiation of wavenumber (or frequency )

which appears as an absorption line in the spectrum. As an example let’s consider the CO molecule. Its reduced

mass is grams and the force constant has a value of dyn cm-1. Substituting

these values in the last equation we obtain for a transition from level to an energy increase

ergs equivalent to cm-1. In Table 2 the vibrational frequencies, wavelengths and

wavenumbers of interesting atmospheric radiative molecules are listed.

7.3  Vibro-rotational bands.

It has been already pointed out that molecules not possessing a permanent dipole moment do in fact possess oscil-

lating dipole moments, caused by their vibrational motion, and therefore rotational transition coupled to vibrational

transition are possible. Considering a simple molecule with one degree of rotational freedom (CO2 for example)

we may therefore observe absorption (and emission) corresponding to quantum energies

where the terms on the right side are taken with their sign. That is a number of transitions are allowed depending

on the number of degrees of rotational freedom and on the number of vibrational modes. A simple description of

the allowed energy transitions are shown in Fig. 11 .

Figure  12. Nitric oxide spectrum.

The more complex the molecular structure the larger the number of possible transitions. As an example Fig. 12

shows the superposition of NO rotational lines close to the vibrational wavenumber at cm-1 with a reso-

lution of 0.06 cm-1 while in Fig. 13 the complex structure due to the three rotational modes of NO2 is superimposed

to its vibrational transition at  cm-1. In the latter the resolution of the measurements is 0.02 cm-1.

Water vapour is one of the most important radiatively active molecules. Its complicated rotational (three degrees

of freedom) and vibrational (three modes) structure produce a line spectrum which, at first sight, appears randomly

distributed. One of the most important H2O absorption feature is the vibro-rotational band at cm
-1. The

central portion of the complex band, close to the vibrational frequency, is shown in Fig. 14 at a resolution of 0.46

cm-1.

At longer wavelengths, micro- and millimetre-wave frequencies, single rotational lines are also observed. Three of

these, due to H2O and O2, are going to play an increasingly important role in microwave remote sensing, namely

the line centred at 64 and 112 (O2) and 183 (H2O) GHz which are shown in Fig. 15 .

8. LINE SHAPES AND THE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT.

For a strictly monochromatic absorption and emission to occur at , the energy involved for each molecule of gas

should be exactly , implying that the energy levels are exactly known. The mathematical

description of the absorption line would be where is the line strength and is the Dirac delta

function centred at . However three physical phenomena occur in the atmosphere (and elsewhere) which pro-

duce broadening of the line: (i) natural broadening, (ii) collision broadening and (iii) doppler broadening, which

will be briefly discussed.

8.1  Natural broadening.

It is caused by smearing of the energy levels involved in the transition. In quantum mechanical terms this is due to

the uncertainty principle and depends on the finite duration of each transition. It can be shown that the appropriate

line shape to describe natural broadening is the Lorentz line shape

molecular oxygen, water vapour and their product (taken from Grody, 1976).

8.2  Collisional broadening.

It is due to the modification of molecular potentials, and hence to the energy levels, which take place during each

emission (absorption) process, and is caused by inelastic as well as elastic collisions between the molecule and the

surrounding ones. The shape of the line is still Lorentzian, as for natural broadening, but the half width is sev-

eral orders of magnitude greater, and is inversely proportional to the mean free path between collisions, which in-

dicates

that will vary depending on pressure and temperature of the gas. When the partial pressure of the

absorbing gas is a small fraction of the total gas pressure we can write:

where and are reference values. As an example the collisional half width for the CO molecule in the

vicinity of the vibrational vibrational transition, at standard pressure and K is nm

8.3  Doppler broadening.

Molecules in a volume of air possess a Maxwell velocity distribution, hence the velocity components along any

direction of observation produce a Doppler effect which induces a shift in frequency in the emitted and absorbed

radiance. The line shape is

where is the molar mass. The Doppler half width for the CO transition of the previous paragraph is

nm which is about 1/8 of the collisional half width. Collisions are the major cause of broadening

in the troposphere, since their effect is proportional to pressure, and pressure variations are larger than temperature

variations; while Doppler broadening is the dominant effect in the stratosphere, due to the larger mean free path

and high temperatures, the latter producing larger standard deviations for the molecular velocity distribution. There

is however an intermediate region where neither of the two shapes is satisfactory since both processes are active at

once. Assuming the collisional and doppler broadening can be assumed to be independent we can combine both

line shapes to give the Voigt shape. This is often used to allow for both tropospheric and stratospheric broadening

of an absorption/emission line in one calculation.

Actually the level of our knowledge of spectroscopic phenomena, that are at the very core of our understanding of

the radiative processes, is still insufficient for many purposes, and a large effort is taking place to perform more

accurate measurements of the key parameters, in order to avoid, whenever possible, the use of empirical tuning to

reduce discrepancies between measurements and model results.

9. CONTINUUM ABSORPTION

In addition to discrete molecular interactions with radiation there is also another important, but less understood,

mechanism for interacting with the incident radiation field called continuum absorption/emission by some atmos-

pheric molecules, most notably water vapour. Continuum absorption manifests itself in the infrared and millimetre

wave window regions of the atmospheric spectrum causing the windows to be less transparent than predicted by

discrete molecular absorption alone. For channels designed to sense the surface this is obviously an important fac-

tor. This continuum absorption/emission has a smooth frequency dependence making it impossible to ascribe to

specific molecular transitions.

There are two main theories for continuum absorption/emission. One is that it is due to the residual effects of the

far wings of strong lines which are not accurately modelled. If there are many strong lines some distance away (in

frequency) the effect of the individual lines can accumulate. A second theory is that the interaction is caused by

molecular polymers (e.g. water vapour dimer) which being large floppy molecules might be expected to have broad

transitions and hence broad spectral features. The exact mechanism continues to be a matter of debate.

Laboratory and field measurements have measured the excess absorption and empirical relationships have been de-

veloped to provide an estimate of the continuum absorption for any atmospheric path. One problem is that most of

the measurements are for warm paths (300 K) whereas most atmospheric paths are colder than this. Nevertheless

empirical relationships are widely used to include this source of absorption/emission in the estimation of the at-

mospheric transmittance. The gases which have significant continuum absorption are H2O, CO2, N2, and O2 and

the continuum is included for all window channel transmittance calculations from the visible to microwaves.

As an example, for the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared window channel at 925 cm-

1, the mean transmittance due to molecular line effects is 0.97 whereas the transmittance due to the continuum is

only 0.93 for a mid-latitude atmosphere.

10. INTEGRATION OVER FREQUENCY

A common requirement for radiometers that are used for sounding the atmosphere is the high radiometric perform-

ance, which can be expressed as a required noise performance or, equivalently, in terms of signal–to–noise ratio.

The latter concept is useful in clarifying that, in order to reach a given performance, it may be necessary to integrate

the signal in the wavenumber domain, and/or in time; another way is to allow more energy to reach the detector by

increasing the solid angle of the measurement. The instruments used to sense operationally the atmosphere are usu-

ally subdivided into two categories: sounders, where the frequency integration is kept to a minimum for reasons

that will be discussed in Section 11, and imagers where the solid angle is minimized. In both cases some degree of

integration in the wave-number domain is required. To simulate the behaviour of the radiometer, and to extract suc-

cessfully information from the set of radiance measurements, it is therefore necessary to compute integrated quan-

tities, like radiance in the interval

where is the transmission of the filter for the radiometer channel. There are several ways in which the integra-

tion can be performed, of different attainable accuracy, and will be only briefly outlined. Although much confusion

is associated to the concept of resolution, the term has been used throughout in these notes to indicate a spectral

width over which either an instrument averages the natural signal, or higher resolution computations have been av-

eraged. Two examples of frequency integration are shown in Fig. 17 .

atmospheric conditions as Fig. 5

10.1  Line-by-line methods

A line-by-line model computes the contribution of each absorption line, within a predefined interval, to the mono-

chromatic optical depth , at a given wave number . The total number, and the wave-number location, of the

monochromatic computations depends on the accuracy to be obtained in the final product, the mean optical depth,

or transmittance, in a wave-number interval that can be as small as required to accurately simulate the radiometer

frequency response. It is the only way to proceed when the aim is accuracy and computer time is less of a problem.

It exploits the information content of the spectroscopic databases (GEISA 1984; HITRAN 1986) and allows the

deficiencies of the spectral parameters to be analysed, provided good laboratory or field data is available.

10.2  Fast-transmittance models.

A line-by-line model can also be used to compute accurate transmittances for a moderate number of atmospheric

temperature and humidity profiles, chosen to represent widely differing atmospheric situations, and then derive co-

efficients for parametric formulas relating the computed transmittances to the input data; the same parametrization

is then used for any atmospheric situation. The line-by-line computations must produce transmittances integrated

over wavenumber intervals much smaller than the channel width of the radiometer to be modelled so that the cor-

rect instrument function can be applied when computing the averaged transmittances for any channel. The final

result of an integration over wavenumber, either performed by the instrument itself or done on computed data, is a

set of average transmittances, or radiances, for each channel of the instrument. The fast model transmittances can

be used in Eq. (12) to compute an upwelling radiance for the radiometer channel.

11. THE DIRECT PROBLEM.

We have seen that for a cloudless atmosphere the equation for upwelling radiance at the upper boundary of the at-

mosphere can be written in the form

(12)

where is the vertical profile of mass mixing ratio of the absorbing (emitting) material (water vapour, CO2,

N2O, O3, etc.), and the subscript s indicates the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Eq. (12) clearly indicates that

the interpretation of the radiance emitted by the atmosphere at a given wavenumber requires a detailed knowledge

of:

(a) spectroscopic properties of all gases radiatively active (which is contained in the term ,

and the transmittance is also function of temperature and absorbing constituent amount along the

ray path;

(b) the vertical profile of the concentration for each radiatively active gas (term ),

(c) the temperature structure  up to a level where emission phenomena become negligible.

(d) the lower surface radiative properties, that is emissivity and skin temperature.

We will now assume that it is possible to derive an equation similar to (12) when dealing with integrated radiance

over a small wave-number interval, and will now try to understand the features of the radiance or brightness tem-

perature spectra shown previously.

There are tens of gaseous species which are radiatively active in this region of the spectrum, although the main

absorbers are CO2, CH4, N2O, O3 and H2O. The first three can be considered as uniformly distributed along the

vertical. With reference to Fig. 5 (or 6 ) the temperature structure can be approximated by the standard atmosphere

with the vertical lapse rate of  K/km. Highest values of  are observed in the range 800–1000 and

1080–1120 cm-1, the so-called infrared window region, since we know, from our spectroscopic knowledge, that

only relatively weak lines are present in that range; consequently most of the emission by the lower (warm) surface

reaches the top of the atmosphere. Skin temperature can be derived from the hottest points in the curve (assuming

that surface emissivity is close to unity) giving a value of K. Lowest values are measured in the strong-

est absorption region of carbon dioxide, from 660–680 cm-1 since, at these wave numbers, radiation emitted by

atmospheric layers close to the ground (and relatively warm) is completely absorbed on its way to mid-troposphere

by the strong and thick lines, and only radiation emitted in the upper tropospheric layers, which are relatively cold,

reaches space (in the upper layers lines are thinner); therefore the measured brightness temperature is low.

There are an infinite number of intermediate cases in which the weighting function peaks somewhere in mid-trop-

osphere, since lines are strong and broad enough to absorb all the surface emission, but radiance originating from

mid tropospheric layers is only partially absorbed, by the now thinner lines, on its way to space. And so on.

The top panel of Fig. 7 needs some further explanation, but along the same lines. When the measurements were

made, over Antarctica, the temperature of the surface was lower that the air temperature in the stratosphere, which

means that the radiance signal coming from the most absorbing regions is actually warmer than the window values.

From this brief discussion it appears therefore that a series of measurements of the emitted upwelling radiance, dis-

tributed from the centre to the wings of an absorption band, contains intermixed information on the vertical tem-

perature and concentration structure. In any case the relation between radiance, temperature and concentration is

highly nonlinear as shown formally by Eq. (12).

The worst limitation to the use of Eq. (12) is due to the fact that even shallow clouds are opaque to infrared radia-

tion. With the exception of thin cirrus, clouds act as a blackbody effectively masking all radiative information com-

ing from below cloud top. Since the typical horizontal dimension for an infrared sounder field of view ranges from

several km to several tens of km, to collect enough energy to maintain a sufficiently high signal–to–noise ratio, a

completely clear atmosphere over the field of view of a sounding instrument is a rarity, especially in meteorologi-

cally active areas where temperature profiles are most needed for accurate weather forecasting. In the microwave,

although scattering by non-precipitating clouds is almost negligible, scattering due to precipitation makes a notice-

able contribution to microwave radiance, hence calculation of temperature without accounting for the scattering

results in large errors. These effects are enhanced when millimetre–wave radiometers, as the 183 GHz radiometer,

which can be used to derive water vapour profile, are used to sound the atmosphere. Uncertainties caused by the

undetected presence of clouds are the greatest source of error in remote sensing of the lower and middle tropo-

sphere. Nevertheless the new millimetre wave radiometers which are starting to fly offer great potential for global

NWP applications as the areas where cloud effects can be neglected will be much greater than for the infrared in-

struments allowing better global coverage.
