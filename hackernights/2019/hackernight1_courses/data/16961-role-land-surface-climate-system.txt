Abstract

The role of the land surface in the climate system is illustrated, with a focus on recent experience at the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Global energy and water budgets are discussed and compared with their
counterparts over the ocean, highlighting physical mechanisms responsible for their differences. Time scales associated with
the global hydrological budget are presented. Using field data and model results, soil moisture is shown to be responsible for
modulating the surface-atmosphere interaction at a continental scale, on time scales ranging from the diurnal to the seasonal.
After a brief review of the impact of land surface on weather, three ECMWF case studies are presented where a more realistic
representation of land surface was crucial for the performance of the forecast system. They correspond, respectively, to the role
of soil moisture in determining the position and intensity of the precipitation maximum in an extreme event of mid-latitudes
summer, the role of albedo of the snow in the presence of forests in spring and the effect of soil water freezing as a thermal
regulator of the surface in cold climates. Finally, the evolution of the systematic errors in the ECMWF forecasts of near surface
temperature and humidity is presented over the last ten years; a clear signature of changes to the representation of land surface
processes (and other physical processes affecting the energy and water fluxes at the surface) can be found on that record.

1. INTRODUCTION

The climate system is influenced by the land surface at a variety of time and spatial scales. Firstly, the atmosphere

is in direct contact with the surface, which acts as a source or sink for the atmospheric enthalpy and moisture (and

as a sink for the atmospheric momentum), via the surface sensible heat flux and evaporation (and the surface stress).

Secondly, the surface conditions act as a regulator for important feedback cycles in the climate system. Thirdly, the

partitioning of net radiation at the surface into sensible and latent heat fluxes determines the soil wetness evolution,

which acts as one of the forcings – or, at the very least, a modulator - of low frequency variability. In fact, after the

sea surface temperature, soil wetness and snow mass are the most important “memory” mechanisms for time scales

ranging from weeks to seasons. Finally, the surface energy fluxes determine to a large extent the surface weather

variables, such as screen-level temperature, humidity, and wind speed and, to a lesser extent, low-level cloudiness

and precipitation. Humankind lives in the lowest two-metres of the atmosphere and is directly affected by the at-

mospheric conditions at the near surface.

This paper illustrates the impact of the land surface in the climate system, with a focus on examples based on recent

experience at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The primary purpose of the

paper is to highlight typical weather regimes/ecosystems where the land surface is of relevance to the evolution of

atmospheric variables, rather than presenting a systematic review of the multifaceted research on surface-atmos-

phere interactions.

The importance of land surface in numerical weather prediction (NWP) stems from a blend of practical consider-

ations and basic physical principles. Those are not very different from the general arguments presented in the open-

ing paragraph, but two key issues are of paramount importance for NWP. First and foremost, accurate forecasts of

near surface weather parameters are requested by the NWP users’ community. The quality of such products as the

diurnal cycle of near surface air temperature and humidity, winds, low level cloudiness and precipitation is to a

large extent determined by the physical realism of the model representation of the surface-atmosphere interactions.

Secondly, remote sensing observations of the atmosphere have increased importance to characterise the state of the

atmosphere over land. The sensors that are sensitive to the lower troposphere can only be used effectively in the

presence of a good quality background field of skin temperature.

It is important to emphasise that, despite the fact that deterministic forecasts of NWP do not extend beyond two

weeks, the model land surface controls much longer time scales. The soil variables in the model are initialised every

6 hours based on indirect, imperfect and very sparse observations (Douville et al. 2000). Data assimilation com-

bines that information with a short-term forecast to get an optimal estimate of the land surface initial conditions.

Cycling the creation of initial conditions is tantamount to an extended model integration nudged by observations

and extends the memory of the surface variables beyond the forecast duration. The realism of the representation of

land surface processes is crucial for handling correctly the memory properties, represented by soil moisture in sub-

tropics and mid-latitudes spring and summer and by snow mass in high latitudes and mountainous areas.

Although the importance of the land surface in the climate system has been established with, among others, the

pioneering work of Namias (1958), Budyko (1963; 1974 and references therein), Manabe (1969), Charney (1975)

–see review by Garratt (1993) - the impact of land surface on weather was only recently recognised, as can be seen

by the scarce literature available. In Section 2 some general remarks on the surface energy and water budget will

be presented, while Section 3 will elaborate on the role of the land surface, with emphasis on the long time scales

characteristic of soil water. In Section 4 some surface-atmosphere interaction mechanisms that are relevant for the

atmospheric simulation at the regional to continental scales are reviewed, based on numerical or observational stud-

ies that are relevant for NWP. Section 5 will illustrate when and where the land surface can affect the weather, based

on examples from recent experience at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). A

short summary is presented in Section 6.

2. SURFACE ENERGY AND WATER BUDGET

Fig. 1 represents in a schematic form the energy and water balance at the land surface. The surface albedo, con-

trolling the fraction of the incident shortwave radiation absorbed by the surface, depends on the soil and vegetation

type and state and on the amount of snow present. The net longwave radiation, LW, depends also on properties of

the land surface, namely the surface emissivity and the surface skin temperature. Since the net radiation flux (the

sum of solar and longwave radiation) is downward, and because the land surface has a small thermal inertia, the

sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes must be an upwards flux. Note that the surface latent heat flux, LE, in the

energy budget (left panel) is equal to the latent heat, L, times the evaporation flux, E, in the water budget (right

panel), indicating that the water is available at the surface in a condensed phase and is passed to the atmosphere in

the vapour phase. In that process, the surface undergoes evaporative cooling.

As mentioned in the introduction, the partitioning of the energy available at the surface into latent and sensible heat

depends crucially on the soil moisture. Vegetated covered surfaces have the ability to draw water from a depth of

order 1 m (the root layer), while for bare ground only the water in the top few cm of soil contributes for evaporation.

The latent and sensible heat fluxes (LE and H, respectively) play a different role for the atmosphere. Sensible heat

at the bottom means energy immediately available to the atmosphere, and contributes to the heating and/or deep-

ening of the planetary boundary layer (BL), that shallow portion of the atmosphere directly affected by the surface.

The surface evaporation flux does not directly heat the atmosphere, but provides moisture to the BL or, in the case

of deep convection, to the whole troposphere. In favourable conditions, that contributes to precipitation generation

mechanisms, with the associated release of latent heat into the whole troposphere. It is clear that, when compared

to the sensible heat flux, evaporation can indirectly lead to a very efficient transfer of energy affecting a much deep-

er atmospheric layer. For an entire atmospheric column, the net radiative cooling is balanced by energy involved

in phase changes inside the column (condensation of water vapour and evaporation of rain) and sensible heat flux

at the surface. Land surface processes affect directly or indirectly this balance.

heat flux, surface longwave and shortwave radiation flux, respectively; E, P, and Y stand for evaporation,

Table 1 summarises the surface annual mean fluxes for the 1979-1993 period covered by the 15 year European Cen-

tre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA15, Gibson et al. 1997). Values presented are

global averages over land and sea separately, in W m-2, and downward fluxes are positive. The net heat flux, G0, is

the sum of all the surface fluxes. The contrasts between land and sea are clear. Even for such a large time period,

the net flux is non-zero over sea, emphasising the larger thermal inertia of the oceans. The continents have a fast

responsive surface and adjust their surface temperature in order to maintain a zero-heat flux at the surface, while

the oceans have a much larger thermal inertia, with relatively small variations in surface temperature and flux im-

balances allowed in much longer time scales. The last column, the Bowen ratio, Bo, is the ratio of sensible and

latent surface heat fluxes. The larger values over land are indicative of the relatively difficulty of accessing the water

at the surface. Over vegetated surfaces, this corresponds to the physiological mechanisms controlling transpiration

while over bare ground the water directly accessible for evaporation is limited to the top few soil cm.

Surface energy fluxes for an entire season (not shown in the table above) still balance out, indicating that the energy

associated to the seasonal changes in soil temperature are negligible when compared to the individual surface en-

ergy fluxes. However, for the surface water balance on a seasonal time scale, the storage term, or change in total

soil water content, can be of similar magnitude to the precipitation or evaporation, which is self-evident in any ex-

tended drought period. In the next section, we will discuss the different time scales regulating the surface and reg-

ulated by the surface.

(arrows in the picture). The sea surface evaporates at the potential rate, while over land there are additional mech-

anisms that reduce the evapotranspiration rate: dryness of the soil or, over vegetated areas, physiological mecha-

nisms that can reduce or shut transpiration from the plant leaves and trunks making the water from the root zone

effectively unavailable for the atmosphere above. Precipitation over land is about a quarter of that over sea. Note

that precipitation exceeds evaporation over land, while over sea the reverse is true. In order to have a closed budget

for the terrestrial atmosphere, advection of moisture across a vertical wall projecting over the continent boundaries

has to match the difference precipitation minus evaporation. Advection is roughly half of the water evaporated over

land (see Peixoto and Oort 1992 for estimates based on radiosonde observations), suggesting an annual recircula-

tion ratio (ratio of the rainfall coming from local evaporation over total rainfall rate) of 67% (71/107). To close the

hydrological cycle, the advection has to be matched by the river runoff: the global averaged influx of fresh water

into the ocean is estimated in this way as 36 x 1015 kg yr-1. For continental areas, annual runoff, evaporation and

precipitation are approximately in the ratio 1:2:3.

Rigorous formulations of the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle can be found in Peixoto 1973 and Peix-

oto and Oort 1983, 1992. So-called “aerological estimates of runoff”, based on measurements of atmospheric water

vapour transport and a closure at the surface, have been applied successfully to basins with areas larger than 106

km2 (Rasmusson 1967, 1968, 1971; Peixoto 1973).

The rainfall rate and the size of the reservoir can be combined to give a time scale 4.5/107 = 0.042 years = 15 days:

the terrestrial atmosphere would be emptied by rainfall in 15 days. In a similar way the reservoir would be replen-

ished by surface evapotranspiration in 23 days (4.5/71 years)1. The time scales associated to marine rainfall are

only 7.5 days, and the corresponding value for evaporation is 6.8 days. This suggests (a) a more vigorous hydro-

logical cycle over the ocean; (b) a land surface control over large time scales (weeks to months), through the eva-

potranspiration flux of water at the surface. The implication of the above on the extended predictability of the

atmosphere due to exchanges of water with the land surface has been discussed by many authors (see, e.g., Namias

1958, Mintz 1984, Dümenil and Bengtsson 1993, Dirmeyer and Shukla 1993).

The accuracy of the numbers shown in Fig. 2 varies widely: see Chahine 1992, for the sources used to produce

these particular estimates. Any literature review shows a very large dispersion in those numbers (see, e.g., Viterbo

1996): global estimates of the total column water vapour can vary by as much as 34%, while runoff estimates differ

by 45%. Independent estimates of precipitation have smaller ranges of uncertainty (notwithstanding the extensive

areas of the planet where observations are very scarce), but direct or indirect estimates of evaporation are subject

to very large uncertainty.

3.2  The role of soil moisture

In order to illustrate the role of soil moisture in shaping the interaction surface-atmosphere, we will use model data

over the Red-Arkansas River basin, a sub-basin of the Mississippi River basin. Data is based on the ECMWF rea-

nalysis ERA15 (Gibson et al. 1997) used also in Section 2. Betts et al. (1998, 1999) have studied the ECMWF mod-

el energy and water budget over the Mississippi River basin, as described by short-term forecasts. Basin-average

data was used for nine years, 1985–93 and analysed at different temporal scales; we will concentrate in this sectio

on summertime 5-day average ECMWF data.

1. The global view on the atmospheric water budget presented in the text can be regionalised, allowing, under certain restrictive assumptions,
an estimate of how much moisture that precipitates comes out from local evaporation versus horizontal transport. For a discussion on the
“intensity of the hydrological cycle”, i.e., the time scales associated to the emptying and repleneshing of the atmospheric water reservoir at dif-
ferent locations on the globe, see Trenberth (1999).

Figure  3. (a) Scatterplot of 5-day average evaporative fraction over warm soils (0-7 cm layer soil temperature >

296 K) against 0-7 cm soil water (SW1). (b) As Fig 3(a), but for pressure height to the lifting condensation level

(PLCL) (from Betts et al. 1998).

We will illustrate here that the ECMWF data shows a similar coupling in the midsummer on the 5-day timescale

between soil water, evaporation and low-level thermodynamics as the First International Satellite Land Surface Cli-

matology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) data2 (Betts and Ball 1998) show on the diurnal time scale. We define

a 5-day mean evaporative fraction as

.

where H and LE are the 5-day averages of the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes. Fig. 3 (a) shows the strong

coupling between EF and the top layer model soil water, SW1. The data plotted are all the 5-day values (1985-

1993) for which the 0-7 cm mean soil temperatures are > 296 K, representative of the warm months.

Fig. 3 (b) shows a similar coupling of PLCL (the pressure height of the lifting condensation level, determining cloud

base) to SW1 for the same data. The model resistance to evaporation between the saturated interior of a “leaf” and

the surrounding air is dependent on soil water, and this vegetation resistance is therefore one key factor in deter-

mining the equilibrium saturation level difference, PLCL, in the saturation pressure budget of the BL (Betts and Ball

1998).

We have shown 5-day averages, but the patterns and slopes in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) are similar (but shifted slightly to

higher PLCL and lower EF) if the 12-h daytime average are used instead. Note that the lower limit in Fig. 3 (b) (cor-

responding to very wet soils) is near the oceanic equilibrium of hPa (e.g., Betts and Ridgway 1989).

The oceanic surface boundary is saturated, and has no additional resistance of evaporation corresponding to the

vegetative resistance over land. Figs. 3 (a) and (b) are particularly significant because neither of these relationships

of EF and PLCL on soil water depend strongly on soil temperature at this warm temperatures.

located in Kansas, US, and heavily instrumented over the period 1987-1989.

3.3  The interplay between the diurnal and the seasonal time scales

Figure  4. (a) Daytime diurnal cycle of potential temperature (q) and mixing ratio (q) at 2 m from 1145 to 2345

UTC for monthly dry-day composites (FIFE averages for 1987); (b) (q, q) plot of surface data for selected 28 days

from July and August 1987, composited by soil moisture, showing the dependence of mean diurnal cycle on

surface evaporation (from Betts et al. 1996).

Fig. 4 (a) (from Betts et al. 1996) shows the daytime diurnal cycle of the FIFE 2-m thermodynamic data for the

predominantly sunny and dry days from May to October 1987. The axes are potential temperature (θ) and mixing
ratio (q). This (θ, q) plot can be regarded as the heat and moisture budget on orthogonal axes (Betts 1992). There
are 19, 21, 25, 22, 23, and 22 dates in each average from May to October. The selection criteria were near-noon

surface net radiation above a threshold (which was 450 W m-2 in midsummer, falling to 300 W m-2 in October) and

no significant daytime rainfall. Here we can see the diurnal and seasonal cycle together. The points are plotted hour-

ly, starting at 1145 UTC, shortly after sunrise in midsummer. The seasonal rise and fall of mean temperature and

mixing ratio can be seen: July is the warmest month. October is noticeably drier, after the vegetation has diedand

evaporation is low. Saturation pressure lines of 970 and 800 hPa are shown dashed. The surface pressure is near

970 hPa. It can be seen that at the morning minimum temperature, the 2 m air is about 30 hPa from saturation, ex-

cept in October, when it is more unsaturated. The diurnal range of mixing ratio q is relatively small in all months.

There is generally a rise of q in the morning, when the BL is shallow and capped by relatively moist air from the

BL of the preceding day, and a fall in the afternoon, as the growing BL entrains drier air from higher levels. May

shows no afternoon fall of q, probably because of the higher soil moisture and evaporation. May and June do not

reach as low afternoon saturation pressures as the later months of July, August, September, and October. This

means a lower mean lifting condensation level (see also previous section) or cloud base in spring. Probably this

reflects a seasonal drying of the surface, although changes in upper air thermodynamic structure may be involved.

It is clear that the afternoon maximum of equivalent potential temperature θe is controlled mostly by the seasonal
shift. The isopleths of θe =310, 330, 350 K are shown dotted. The rise of θe from morning minimum to afternoon
maximum is around 14 K in all months.

The sum of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes is a surface source for increasing θe (e.g., Betts and Ball 1998).
This surface θe is proportional to the sum of H+LE, and it is not affected by the Bowen ratio. It is entrainment of
low θe air from above the BL, together with the deepening of the BL, that reduce the BL θe rise, and so feed back
on both the shallow and even more importantly on precipitating convection. Thus one of the important aspects of

the BL evolution over land is how large entrainment at BL top is. The daytime BL over land is primarily thermally

generated (in strong winds, shear plays a role), and thus linked to the surface virtual heat flux (which over land is

usually dominated by the sensible heat flux). Hence if the surface Bowen ratio is large, although the surface θe flux

may be unchanged, the large H flux drives more entrainment, produces a deeper BL, and the diurnal rise of θe is
reduced. Fig. 4 (b) shows how this diurnal cycle over land depends on soil moisture and, as a consequence, the

surface evaporation.

A total of 28 days from July and August 1987 during FIFE, which were affected little by precipitation or cold air

advection, were composited by soil moisture (SM: measured gravimetrically in the top 10 cm). The points are hour-

ly values from 1115 UTC (near sunrise) to 2315 UTC. The dry soil composite (SM = 13%, for which the measured

mean surface Bowen ratio at noon was 0.8) reaches a higher afternoon maximum K (the θe isopleths are
shown dotted). In contrast, the wet soil composite (SM = 23.4%), for which Bowen ratio at noon was 0.4), reaches

a much cooler afternoon θ maximum, but a much wetter q value, so that the afternoon K. Some of this
shift of θe is associated with the shift of the entire diurnal path of higher q with higher soil moisture, but about half
is the result of reduced entrainment of dry low θe into the BL. Over wet soils, H is much reduced and the BL deep-
ens less rapidly. For all the three composites, the surface available fluxes (net radiation minus ground heat flux)

were nearly identical, so that the surface θe fluxes were similar. This local feedback between soil moisture, evap-
oration and afternoon θe equilibrium probably produces on large spatial scales a positive feedback between soil
moisture and precipitation, which has been the subject of much research (see, for example, Brubaker et al. 1993,

Trenberth 1999). The analogy over the tropical oceans is the link between BL and sea surface temperature (SST),

which influences the prevalence of deep convection over warm water. Over land variations in soil moisture can lead

to as large variations in BL θe as larger as those produced by several degrees of change in SST. On continental
scales, higher soil moisture and higher evaporation over land would lead to a higher afternoon θe maximum relative
to the surrounding ocean and shift more of the global precipitation over the continents (Betts et al. 1996). This feed-

back has been seen in global models (Mintz 1984). On the regional scale, the Mississippi flood case study, present-

ed in Section 5.1 below, suggested that the multiple BLs over the Midwestern United States controlled the location

of precipitation, rather than this mechanism.

3.4  A schematic view of the role of land surface

To conclude this section, a schematic description of the interactions between the surface and the atmosphere will

be presented. Inspired by an early, much more complex diagram by Horton (1931), Dooge (1992) (see also Kuhnel

et al. (1991)) summarised the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere in the picture reproduced

(with adaptations) in Fig. 5 . The diagram illustrates the behaviour of the soil and the atmosphere within a complete

cycle composed of a wet period followed by a dry period. Let us start just after a long episode of rainfall, point A

in the figure. The soil water is available in abundance in the root layer3 and its evolution is going to be determined

by evaporation. While the soil has plenty of water, the rate of evaporation is controlled by the near-surface atmos-

pheric moisture: the regime is controlled by the atmosphere and the evaporation is at the potential rate. Below a

certain level of soil moisture (point B in the picture), physiological mechanisms will limit the supply of water from

the root layer into the atmosphere, and the evaporation will drop below its maximum value (potential evaporation,

Epot). The regime is under a vegetation (soil) control. When precipitation starts (points C) it will meet a soil dry

enough during the initial stages, so that infiltration (If, that part of water that falls as precipitation and is effectively

collected by the soil for future use) will equal precipitation. The evolution of water in the soil is once more atmos-

pheric controlled, via the rate of precipitation. Beyond a certain value (point D), the soil does not have the ability

to soak all precipitation, some of it goes into runoff. This last phase is again soil controlled; the state of the soil

determines the rate of infiltration.

Land surface parametrizations have to represent correctly the surface fluxes and the evolution of soil moisture in

3.   For the purpose of this discussion, field capacity may be considered as the threshold beyond which there is a minimum canopy resistance
to evaporation.

all four phases of the cycle, and to switch from the atmospheric control into the soil control regime. The evolution

of soil moisture will determine when point D will occur, and the evaporation formulation will determine point B.

The crucial areas, from the point of view of the atmosphere, are the quadrants BC and CD. During spring and sum-

mer (where the atmospheric demand can be very large), the system remains much longer in the half-circumference

BCD than in the opposite part of the cycle.

4. IMPACT OF LAND SURFACE ON WEATHER: A BRIEF LITERATURE SURVEY

Betts et al. (1996) review the impact of land surface in the context of global numerical weather prediction: Diurnal

and seasonal feedback loops are discussed as well as feedback loops controlling the BL evolution. We will high-

light here typical mechanisms controlling the interaction between land surface and the atmosphere, over the US,

Europe, and the tropics.

Early modelling efforts (Benjamin and Carlson 1986; Lanicci et al. 1987) have shown the sensitivity of precipita-

tion in the US Great Plains to evaporation upstream, in the Mexican Plateau. The characteristic storm environment,

leading to heavy precipitation over the Midwest, involves the breakdown of a capping inversion formed by an over-

lying pre-existing boundary layer from the Mexican plateau, which overlies the cool moist BL originating in the

Gulf of Mexico. This complex pattern of differential advection impacts on the strength of the capping inversion,

and the strength of the inversion is controlled by evaporation upstream of the precipitation area. Lower values of

evaporation lead to a stronger capping inversion, and the low level flow from the Gulf will not break through the

inversion until much further north. The location and extent of the heavy precipitation associated with the July 1993

US floods was found to be highly sensitive to the correct representation of these mechanisms in the ECMWF model

(Beljaars et al. 1996; Viterbo and Betts 1999a; Section 5.1).

Spatial gradients of soil moisture can also enhance the differential heating maintaining and reinforcing the surface

front in a pre-storm environment and intensifying the thermally direct (ageostrophic) circulation (Chang and Wet-

zel 1991; Fast and McCorcle 1991). A similar mechanism is active in a cold front associated with a severe squall

line developing explosively (Koch et al. 1997).



The role of the land surface in the climate system

The seasonality of leaf area index impacts on the systematic errors of US Midwest lower tropospheric temperature

in summer (Xue et al. 1996; Yang et al. 1994). At a smaller scale, there are many observational and modelling

studies demonstrating the importance of mesoscale fluxes and smaller-scale heterogeneity, specially at low wind

speeds.

Over Europe, Rowntree and Bolton (1983) demonstrated the role of local and non-local response of medium-range

rainfall forecasts to anomalies in the initial soil. The mechanisms relevant to this soil moisture-precipitation feed-

back were scrutinised in Schär et al. (1999) in a study demonstrating the impact of idealised (and large) anomalies

of soil water on the European summer circulation. Unlike the desert-albedo feedback hypothesis (Charney 1975),

the European soil-precipitation feedback is not of a large-scale dynamical nature, i.e., it is not associated to changes

in large-scale flow. Precipitation recycling has also a small role in Europe. Three main feedback loops have been

identified. Wet soils, associated with low Bowen ratios, lead to the build-up of a shallow BL, concentrating moist

entropy at low levels and giving higher values of convective available potential energy (CAPE). Additionally, lower

Bowen ratios lead to higher relative humidity, lowering the level of free convection. Finally, a positive feedback of

radiative origin, with increased cloud cover, but larger net radiative flux, leads to larger moist entropy and convec-

tive instability.

All the examples above refer to extratropics spring and summer examples, in snow free situations. Section 5.2 be-

low presents spring examples in the presence of snow. There is little or no impact of land surface on the atmospheric

circulation in winter (see Giorgi (1990) and Section 5.3 below).

Despite an extensive list of publications on the role of land-surface in the tropical climate, there is scanty evidence

of its impact for short- and medium-range forecasts. A notable exception is the work of Walker and Rowntree

(1977) who demonstrated the role of enhanced soil moisture gradients on the short-range (1-2 days ahead) forecast

of the generation of easterly waves, using a simplified model over West Africa.

5. EXAMPLES FROM ECMWF RECENT EXPERIENCE

5.1  Soil moisture

July 1993 showed anomalously high precipitation over the Central USA, with exceptional flooding of the Missis-

sippi (Changnon 1996). During this month, the new version of the ECMWF model (CY48) and the then operational

version (CY47)4, were running in parallel at full resolution (spectral truncation T213, grid-point spacing ~ 60 km),

including data assimilation. Beljaars et al. (1996) compared the performance of the two schemes, looking at the

average of all one-, two- and three-day forecasts verifying between 9 and 25 July. While the day one precipitation

of the two systems were very similar, and similar to the observed precipitation, the forecasts at day 3 were markedly

different. In the new system, the location and intensity of the maximum precipitation was similar to the observa-

tions (40 N, 95 W), while the old system had less then half the precipitation amount in the area of the observed

maximum and had a spurious maximum of precipitation displaced 800 km NE. In the old system, there was a grad-

ual reduction in precipitation from day 1 to day 3, while the new system was able to better maintain the intensity.

However, evaporation at the area of maximum precipitation was similar for the old and new system, and in both

systems there was no evidence of forecast spin down, strongly suggesting that the local evaporation was not re-

4. The main differences between CY47 and CY48 rely on the surface and boundary layer processes parametrization. The soil model in CY48
has 4 layers, with no heat flux and free drainage bottom boundary condition, with soil properties (heat and water conductivities and diffusivi-
ties) dependent in a non-linear way on soil moisture (Clapp and Hornberger 1978). CY47 has 2 layers plus 1 climate layer underneath, with
constant water soil properties. CY48 has a smaller roughness length for heat than for momentum, while in CY47 they are identical. For more
details see Viterbo and Beljaars (1995).

sponsible for the differences in precipitation. It turns out that the maximum of the evaporation difference was lo-

cated over the Mexican Plateau, 1000 km SW of the precipitation maximum, two to three days upstream as

suggested by backwards trajectories ending up at 750 hPa, 40 N, 95 W. The mean thermodynamic profiles, similar

for day 1 forecasts, were very different for day 3 forecasts. The old model showed a too strong capping inversion

above the BL, with air too warm and too dry and much lower values of CAPE. It is clear that the differential ad-

vection mechanism characteristic of the US Monsoon was responsible for the differences in precipitation. When

compared to the new model, the soil on the Mexican Plateau had much lower values of soil moisture in CY47, giv-

ing a much reduced evaporation, which in turn produced a warm and dry air mass that capped the BL downstream,

inhibiting convection. In CY47, the soil model values were strongly forced to an erroneous, too dry, climatology:

In such a data dense area, atmospheric profiles were initiated to correct values, but during the forecast they slowly

felt the influence of the erroneous soil moisture values. In CY48 the soil moisture values were initialised to field

capacity at the beginning of July, consistent with values of June precipitation in the area much above normal. There

was no forcing to climatology in CY48 (Viterbo and Beljaars 1995) and the model was capable of maintaining high

values of moisture throughout July. Monthly integrations performed with CY47 and CY48 suggested the impor-

tance of the memory associated to idealised soil moisture anomalies in the initial conditions (Beljaars et al. 1996).

The monthly precipitation fields with CY48 compared much better to observations than those of CY47.

Figure 6. Profiles (so-called tefigrams) of temperature (solid line) and dewpoint (dashed line) with CY47 (a) and

CY48 (b) of the averages verifying from 9 to 25 July at the forecast range 78 hours. The model location is 40 N 95

W. (c) shows the average verifying analysis. The shading indicates the area where a parcel lifted from the surface

has a lower temperature than the surrounding air, i.e., the shaded surface area is a measure for the stability a parcel

has to overcome before convection can occur (from Beljaars and Viterbo 1999).

CY48 surface model ran with predicted soil moisture throughout the first half of 1994. It was clear that a very large

near-surface warm and dry bias developed over the NH continental areas at the end of spring and beginning of sum-

mer. A scheme to initialise soil water based on the short-term forecast errors of near-surface atmospheric humidity

was developed to overcome that problem (Viterbo 1996). In order to test the new scheme, three complete data as-

similation-forecast experiments were ran at T213 for the month of June 1994: (a) Control (CY48, no assimilation

of soil moisture); (b) As control, but using the initialised soil moisture values, and; (c) As in (b), but using a prog-

nostic cloud scheme with much more realistic cloud cover over land (Tiedtke 1993). The near-surface warm and

dry bias, reduced from Control to the initialised soil water experiment, in response to a wetter soil. A lower tropo-

spheric warm bias developed in the Control model and was greatly reduced when initialisation of soil water is used.

Both experiments had too little cloud cover over land with too large surface shortwave radiative fluxes, but the wet-

ter soil conditions of experiment (b) managed to maintain evaporation in the face of excessive net radiation at the

surface. The third simulation displayed even smaller biases, associated with a larger, more realistic cloud cover and

smaller radiative biases.

The algorithm to initialise soil water is successful in controlling model drifts but dampens the seasonal cycle and

interannual variations of evaporation and soil moisture. Viterbo and Betts (1999a) revisited the July 1993 simula-

tion, using the initial soil water algorithm and the prognostic cloud scheme. The new system gives poorer results

for precipitation than Beljaars et al. (1996). Although much better than CY47, there is a suggestion of northward

displacement and reduction in the precipitation maximum in day 2 forecasts. It appears that the initialisation of soil

moisture at field capacity at the beginning of July in Beljaars et al. was crucial to obtain a good simulation of the

excessive rainfall events.

5.2  Boreal forests

Surface albedo is the prime regulator of the net energy available at the surface. The albedo of snow-free land sur-

faces ranges from values of 0.1 in forests to values of 0.35 over deserts. For areas seasonally covered with snow,

that range can extend up to 0.85. Betts and Ball (1997) analysed the annual cycle of albedo in the BOREAS exper-

iment, performed in Canada during 1994, focussing on the snow season, comparing several measurement sites lo-

cated over grass, aspen and coniferous. Representative values for daily averaged albedo of snow-covered grass sites

are 0.75, while corresponding values for the aspen and conifer sites are 0.21 and 0.13, respectively, with values as

high as 0.4, one to two days after snowfall. The lower albedo of the boreal forests in the presence of snow corrob-

orates data from other observational studies and the few attempts of making a hemispheric-satellite based estimate

of albedo.

The ECMWF model version of 1994, at the time of the BOREAS experiment, treated the albedo of snow covered

areas with no regard to the land cover: beyond a critical value for snow depth, the albedo of snow covered areas

was rarely outside the 0.7-0.8 range. As a result, when compared to experimental results, net radiation was too low

and near-surface air temperatures were too cold. A modification to the scheme was designed such as the albedo of

snow-covered surfaces tended to the asymptotic value of 0.2 in the presence of forests and 0.7 otherwise (Viterbo

and Betts 1999b). The modified scheme has much reduced biases in temperature and radiation in the high latitudes.

The cold bias in temperature in the control scheme extended in the vertical to the whole troposphere, increasing

with forecast range and affecting most continental areas. The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the day 5 forecast error

of 850 hPa temperature, averaged for March and April in 1996. The very high albedo induces cooling errors ex-

ceeding –3 K in North America and –7 K in Asia. The top panel shows the corresponding figure for 1997. In spring

1997, with the new snow albedo scheme, the cold bias over the boreal forest has been almost eliminated. The new

scheme also improved the quality of the medium-range forecasts, as evidenced by better scores of 500 hPa geo-

potential fields.

Figure  7. Comparison of the average 5-day forecast temperature errors at 850 hPa, for the ECMWF operational

model during March-April 1996 (bottom) and 1997 (top) (from Viterbo and Betts 1999b).

The forecast results above corroborate the study of Thomas and Rowntree (1992) on the role of the boreal forests

in conditioning the climate at high latitudes. The spring months of two five-year experiments, the first with a (re-

alistic) snow albedo and the second with the high latitude forests removed are compared. The latter experiment is

colder than the former in the continental areas north of 50 N. Pielke and Vidale (1995) suggested that the boundary

between tundra and boreal forests is a region of enhanced horizontal temperature gradients, acting as a pre-condi-

tioner for baroclinic instability and “locking” the climatological position of the polar front. In analysing further

refinements to the ECMWF snow model,van den Hurk et al. (2000) show that (a) simulating the boreal forest con-

trol on evaporation in spring (reduced transpiration from frozen soils) and (b) increasing the runoff over frozen

soils, improves the agreement of model results with observations.

5.3  Soil water freezing: A regulator of cold climates

The operational ECMWF forecasts for the winters of 1993-94 through to 1995-96 showed a tendency to produce

a cold bias over continental areas in winter. This error was particularly severe during the winter of 1995-96 for

Scandinavia, a year characterised by reduced snow amounts and, consequently, larger thermal coupling between

the soil and the atmosphere above. Viterbo et al. (1999) diagnosed two main problems contributing to that error.

Firstly, the energy involved in phase changes in the soil was not taken into account. When positive temperatures

approach 0 C, a substantial amount of the external cooling demand (i.e., infrared cooling) is used to freeze the soil

 ECMWF, 2002

water, thereby decreasing the rate of soil cooling; a similar effect occurs in melting. Soil water phase transitions

act as a thermal barrier, increasing the soil inertia at temperatures close to 0 C. Secondly, the downward sensible

heat flux, prevailing in winter conditions, was too small, leading the model into a positive feedback loop where

cooling reduced the heat flux, and made the soil even colder. Model changes were designed to incorporate the miss-

ing physical mechanisms. Separate seasonal integrations with both model schemes revealed a greatly alleviated soil

and near-surface atmospheric cooling drift: Screen-level temperatures reduced from –10 C to close to zero. Despite

the considerable warming in the model soil and near-surface winter climate in continental areas, there was negli-

gible impact on the free atmosphere temperature and the atmospheric flow. In winter, stable situations, the atmos-

phere is decoupled from the surface and changes at the surface do not propagate upwards, unless they affect the

momentum budget.

6. CONCLUSIONS

The examples presented above have shown that land surface can have a significant impact on the atmosphere at the

synoptic/continental scale when it affects the partitioning of the surface energy into sensible/latent heat, via the soil

water. This effect can be local or non-local. On the other hand, land surface has a significant impact on the atmos-

phere at the synoptic/continental scale when it affects the net energy at the surface, e.g., change of the albedo in

snow-covered areas in spring. However, in winter, statically stable, conditions the land surface is decoupled from

the atmosphere: Large variations in surface temperature affect only the lowest hundred metres of the atmosphere

and do not have a significant impact on the circulation.

Recent experience at ECMWF, summarised above, shows that forecasts systems are sensitive to misrepresentations

of longer timescales in the land-surface/atmosphere interaction. Progress can only be made with sustained efforts

on validation of the model components. Data assimilation/forecast systems are ideal tools to validate parameteri-

sations because of their constant confrontation with observations (in a “perfect synoptics” scenario) and a very

large community of users requiring accurate diurnal cycle of weather parameters. In this context, GEWEX (Global

Energy and Water Experiment) Continental Scale Experiments and the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Period

planned for 2002 will play a prominent role. If the surface and upper-air observations arrive at the NWP centres

they can be assimilated. Analysis and short term forecasts from those centres are the best hope of having a coherent

picture of surface and atmosphere variables and of the surface fluxes.

Figure 8. History of monthly biases (thick lines) and standard deviations (thin lines) with respect to observations

of the daytime (72-hour: red line) and night-time (60 hour: blue line) operational two-metre temperature forecasts,

averaged for all available surface stations in the European area (30º N to 72º N and 22º W to 42º E).

An important feedback loop in the surface-atmosphere interaction is the link between the anomalies of soil mois-

ture and precipitation. Its correct representation in the model relies on the interplay of several parameterisations:

evaporation and soil moisture, boundary layer processes, clouds and convection. Most NWP models have their

poorest scores on precipitation in the tropics and spring/summer extratropics and improvements on the understand-

ing of the soil moisture-convection interaction will most likely greatly alleviate that deficiency. Validation of model

results against results from the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) (see forthcom-

ing Special Issue of J. Geophys.Res. 2001) observations of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and atmospheric ther-

mal and humidity profiles over the Amazon River Basin will probably be a key for progress in that area.

Probably the best summary of the impact of land surface on weather can be shown on Fig. 8 , displaying the history

of ECMWF operational short-range forecast errors of 2 m temperature over Europe as a time-series of monthly

averages. These errors show a large annual cycle, are different for night and day (72 and 60 hour forecasts verifying

at 12 and 00 UTC, respectively), and have a rich history of the many model changes that were made over the years.

We will discuss only the model changes made from 1993 onwards.

In August 1993, a surface scheme with a climatological deep-soil boundary condition for temperature and moisture

was replaced by the free-running four-layer scheme (Viterbo and Beljaars 1995), but the impact is not very obvious.

The summer daytime bias of August 1993 was smaller than that of the previous year but, at that time, the soil

scheme has been running freely for only two-months (including the July parallel test described earlier). The next

summer showed a pronounced warm bias related to a gradual drying out of the soil which was reduced in July 1994

by resetting the soil moisture to field capacity over vegetated areas. A simple soil moisture analysis scheme was

introduced in December 1994 (Viterbo 1996) with a clear beneficial impact on the daytime bias for summer 1995.

The night-time temperatures have been biased cold for many years, related to an overly large amplitude of the di-

urnal cycle. The winter of 1995/1996 was particularly bad, mainly because the European area was blocked for most

of the winter with easterly winds and very cold temperatures, although changes to the cloud scheme or the oro-

graphic drag might have had a negative impact on night-time temperatures. It is interesting that the reduction of the

daytime bias actually increased the night-time bias by displacing the entire diurnal cycle to colder temperatures.

Soil freezing and increased boundary layer diffusion in stable layers, introduced in September 1996, improved the

monthly error statistics considerably. The wintertime bias was largely eliminated and the amplitude of the diurnal

cycle was down to a reasonable level. The snow albedo reduction described in Section Boreal forests was intro-

duced in December 1996, but its impact is not clear over Europe, due to the relatively small area covered by snow

and the overall magnitude of the errors linked to the excessive soil cooling, corrected three months earlier. Finally,

a much more selective way of initialising soil moisture (Douville et al. 2000), introduced in April 1999, might be

responsible for a slight reduction of the standard deviation of temperature errors in that year. A new surface scheme

was introduced in June 2000 (van den Hurk et al. 2000), but it is too early to assess its operational performance. It

is fair to point out that the statistics presented in Figure 8 are averaged over a month and over a large area. The

errors on a day-to-day basis can still be large, but are less systematic and are often related to errors in the forecasted

clouds or the presence of snow.
