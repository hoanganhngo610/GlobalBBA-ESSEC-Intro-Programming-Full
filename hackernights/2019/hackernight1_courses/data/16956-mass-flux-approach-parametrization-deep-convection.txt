1. INTRODUCTION

Although the principles of the mass-flux approach to convection were formulated in the 1970s and formed the basis

for the well known "Arakawa–Schubert" scheme (Arakawa and Schubert 1974) it has only been recently that such

schemes have been used in many GCMs due to their expense compared to simpler schemes (moist convective ad-

justment and Kuo-type schemes). The approach has a stronger physical basis than these earlier methods and pro-

vides an understanding of how convection affects the large-scale atmosphere. It also allows more physically based

microphysical treatments to be employed and vertical transports of tracers by convection to be estimated, of im-

portance when considering the impact that aerosols have upon climate.

This paper will outline the mass-flux approach to the parametrization of convection, concentrating "bulk" type

schemes such as those used in the ECMWF forecast model (Tiedtke 1989) and the UK Met. Office Unified Model

(Gregory and Rowntree 1990). Important issues relating to this approach are discussed by reference to the Tiedtke

scheme at ECMWF, although reference is made to other schemes as appropriate. Only brief comments are made

concerning the more complex "spectral" cloud model approach, of which the Arakawa–Schubert scheme is the

best known example.

2. THE NEED FOR PARAMETRIZATION.

Within large-scale models of the atmosphere the horizontal length scale on which the convection exists is below

the resolution used, and so the effects of such clouds must be parametrized in terms of the large-scale flow. Ex-

pressing the temperature structure of the atmosphere in terms of a large-scale mean and an unresolved eddy con-

tribution,

(1)

the thermodynamic equation of the large-scale flow may be written as,

(2)

where is the radiative heating rate and is termed the apparent convective heat source (Yanai et al. 1973).

The left-hand side contains large-scale terms only, while the right-hand side of Eq. (2) represents the impact of ra-

diation and small-scale motions upon the large-scale flow. Convection is seen to affect the large-scale flow through

condensational heating and the vertical transport of heat. A similar treatment is applicable to the moisture equation

leading to the definition of , the apparent moisture sink due to convection and also the horizontal momentum

equation, defining , the impact of convection upon horizontal momentum.

3. MASS-FLUX THEORY OF CONVECTION

The mass-flux approach was first formulated by Ooyama (1971). It is assumed within some area A, taken to be

the grid point of a numerical model, that a fraction is covered by cloud. Hence the area average of is given by

where  is the value of  within cloudy air,  that within the environment of the cloud.

It is normally assumed that  and so,

Table 1 provides an indication of the magnitude of the error in the environmental temperature and mixing ratio

through the use of Eq. (4), together with the impact upon estimation of parcel buoyancy, evaluated as,

(5)

Absolute errors are generally small even when is large, which may be the case when the grid size is reduced to

that found in meso-scale models (on the order of 10–20 km). Thus, the theoretical formulation developed below

is fairly accurate. However, errors in buoyancy (a temperature difference) are much larger. As buoyancy is the

main driving force for convection this may lead to errors in the estimation of the intensity of convection.

Consider now the eddy flux divergent contribution to .  From Eq. (1) it can be written that

(6)

Using Eq. (3) to expand the first term of the r.h.s. of Eq. (6) and in the second term, after rearrangement Eq. (6)

can be written as

(7)

Using Eq. (4), and assuming the vertical velocity in the environment is much smaller than that within cloudy air so

that motions are only weakly correlated with thermodynamic variables, the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (7) can

be neglected.  The vertical eddy flux due to convective motions is then written approximately as

(8)

Hence from Eq. (2)  can be expressed as,

(9)

The latent-heating term associated with the cloud environment is usually interpreted as the evaporation of cloud

condensate and precipitation detrained from the cloud into clear air leading to a cooling of the cloud environment.

From Eq. (9) it is seen that has been expressed in terms of cloud and large-scale variables. The latter are avail-

able from the grid-point fields of the numerical model while the former are usually obtained from the use of a model

of a convective cloud, typically a one-dimensional steady-state entraining-plume model of the cloud.

Following the analysis of Gregory and Miller (1989), consider the thermodynamic and continuity equation aver-

aged over an individual cloud (denoted by the subscript i);

use in a scheme and it is usual to approximate the horizontal advection across the cloud boundary, the fluxes across

the cloud boundary as it varies with height and the horizontal growth of the cloud with time by entrainment and

detrainment fluxes;

(12)

(13)

where is the entrainment rate (the rate at which air is included into the cloud through its sides to balance the

increase of vertical mass flux in the cloud with height), and the detrainment rate (the rate at which air leaves the

cloud as the cloud vertical mass flux decreases with height).  These are  defined as

(14)

These equations are for one cloud only, whereas in the area under consideration it is assumed that there are many

clouds.  Summing over all cloud within the ensemble, Eqs. (12) and (13) can be written as,

(15)

(16)

where and , the summation being carried out over all clouds. The summation on the l.h.s

of Eq. (15) is over all clouds which are undergoing terminal detrainment. It has also been assumed that the whole

ensemble is in a steady state, and so remaining time dependent terms can be neglected.

Substitution of Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (9) gives, after rearrangement,

(17)

A similar analysis can be applied to the moisture equation to obtain and the horizontal momentum equation to

give .

Convection modifies the large-scale atmosphere through;

(a) compensating subsidence—motion in the clear environment surrounding the cloud compensating

motion within the cloud (a consequence of mass continuity),

(b) detrainment of cloudy air into the environment,

(c) the evaporation of cloud condensate and precipitation within the environment—either through

detrainment or below cloud base as precipitation falls to the surface. This later term is closely tied

to microphysical processes and, because of the fall-out of precipitation, is not uniquely related to

the mass-flux and condensation profiles within the convection.

4. EVALUATION OF MASS-FLUX THEORY

Several authors have attempted to diagnose the magnitude of the terms in Eq. (17) using observations (e.g Yanai

et al. 1973). However this method relies on using simple cloud models, identical to those used in parametrization

schemes, to estimate in-cloud variables. The technique is essentially using a convective parametrization in a diag-

nostic mode. More recently diagnostics from cloud-resolving models have helped to understand the mass-flux ap-

proach (e.g. Gregory and Miller 1989). Fig. 1 from the latter study (a simulation of convection during phase 3 of

GATE) compares the vertical structure of with that of compensating subsidence and the evaporation of con-

densate within the cloud environment. Compensating subsidence is seen to follow closely in the vertical, ex-

ceeding it at most levels. This excess of heating is compensated by the evaporation term. The detrainment of

cloudy air plays only a secondary role for deep convection, although it is of greater importance in shallow convec-

tion (see Soong and Ogura 1980). These results agree with studies using observational data, for example that of

Yanai et al. (1973) using data from the west Pacific.

Figure  1. Profile of compensating subsidence (dot-dash), evaporation of cloud and precipitation (dotted), their

sum (solid) and net Q1 (dashed) for convection in a phase III GATE easterly wave (From Gregory and Miller

1989).

However for , Gregory and Miller (1989) suggest that a combination of compensating subsidence and the evap-

oration of condensate within the cloud environment is not a good approximation (Fig. 2 ), drying at 800 mb being

overestimated by this approximation and underestimated below this level. This is a consequence of several factors.

Firstly above 800 mb detrainment plays a much larger role in the moisture budget than for temperature (see also

the recent study by Guichard et al. (1996)). As the air detrained from convection is saturated, its mixing ratio is

usually further away from the environmental value than is the case for temperature, and so detrainment has a much

larger impact in the moisture budget than in the corresponding heat budget. This was also noted in earlier obser-

vational studies. In the lowest 200 mb of the domain the difference is partially caused by the inability of the coarse-

resolution model to simulate shallow convection, but also by the fact that "entrainment" into the lower part of the

cloud dries the domain. This is due to the environment around the base of the convection being wetter than the

average across the domain, implying that the large-scale average value of mixing ratio is a poor representation of

air flowing into convection near cloud base. This effect is not usually accounted for in parametrization schemes.

In general the moisture errors found in GCMs in convective regions are larger than those for temperature, partially

a consequence of poor formulation of the entrainment and detrainment processes for moisture used in current

schemes.

sum (solid) and net Q2 (dash) for convection in a phase III GATE easterly wave (From Gregory and Miller 1989).

Cloud resolving models allow the contribution of updraughts and downdraughts to the net convective heating and

drying to be determined. Fig. 3 shows due to updraughts and downdraughts for the GATE simulation of Gre-

gory and Miller (1989). The heating due to updraughts is twice , the excess heating being compensated by the

cooling due to the evaporation of precipitation with downdraughts. Such a large contribution to the net heating

implies that it is important to include downdraught processes in convective parametrizations. Similar conclusions

have also been reached from observational studies (e.g. Betts 1973).

5. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF MASS-FLUX THEORY

Application of the above theory in a numerical model is a two-stage process. Firstly a cloud model must be used

to estimate the vertical distribution of the cloudy quantities, and secondly the magnitude of the mass flux at the base

of the cloud must be determined, usually by some reference to the large-scale structure and forcing (the closure

problem).

5.1  Estimation of cloud properties

Two approaches are commonly to estimate the quantities required to implement the mass-flux theory as a para-

metrization scheme. The first approach uses a spectral cloud ensemble, in which several different cloud models

are used to represent differing cloud types within a grid box of a GCM. In the second approach, the bulk cloud-

model method, a single cloud model is used to represent an ensemble of clouds. The strengths and weaknesses of

each approach are discussed below.

5.1 (a)  Spectral cloud ensemble approach. This technique was first introduced by Arakawa and Schubert

(1974). They assumed that within a grid box of a GCM a spectrum of different height clouds existed. Each cloud

is characterised by a different entrainment rate, and so a different cloud top height (Fig. 4 ). Clouds with large

entrainment rates terminate lower in the atmosphere (cloud 1), while those with lower entrainment rates follow a

more undiluted ascent, and so terminate in the upper troposphere (cloud 3). In theory, the number of different cloud

types within the distribution is arbitrary with clouds allowed to terminate at any level in the atmosphere, but in prac-

tice the number of cloud types is limited by the number of vertical levels in the model, one cloud type detraining

at each model layer.

Figure 4. Schematic of spectral cloud ensemble approach. Curves 1,2 and 3 represent ascent of air in clouds with

differing entrainment rates.

The cloud-base mass flux must be estimated for each cloud type (the "closure problem"), determining how much

that cloud type contributes to the ensemble mean. The original version of the Arakawa–Schubert scheme required

an iterative solution to solve for the distribution of mass flux associated with each cloud type, but in recent years

the scheme has undergone some modification (e.g. Moorthi and Suarez 1992) in order to reduce its complexity and

increase its robustness, while still retaining the spectral cloud-ensemble approach.

5.1 (b)  Bulk cloud model approach. Because of the complexity (and hence the computational expense) of the

spectral cloud-ensemble approach, several schemes have been developed using the simpler bulk-cloud model ap-

proach suggested by Yanai et al. (1973). In this method, only one cloud model is used to represent an ensemble of

clouds within a grid box, the cloud properties predicted being averages over the cloud ensemble whose members

have ascents ranging from cloud type 1 to cloud type 3 (Fig. 5 ). Both the mass-flux scheme of Tiedtke (1989) used

in the ECMWF model, and the UK Meteorological Office scheme (Gregory and Rowntree 1990), use this ap-

proach. The approach has also been used in meso-scale models (e.g. Fritsch and Chappel 1980) where, due to

smaller grid sizes, it is reasonable to assume that only one cloud type exists within a grid box. The method is cheap-

er and simpler to implement, and both of these schemes have the additional advantage over the Arakawa–Schubert

scheme that they are able to represent convection that is not rooted in the planetary boundary layer (for example as

seen in mid-latitude warm fronts).

5.2  Issues in the formulation of bulk mass-flux schemes

Here discussion of the mass-flux approach is focused upon issues relating to the bulk cloud-model approach. The

Tiedtke scheme, used in the ECMWF model, is used to illustrate issues which must be addresses in designing such

a scheme.

5.2 (a)  Determination of cloud type. In the spectral cloud model approach, several cloud types with differing

lateral mixing rates and cloud-top heights are present within each grid box, the "closure method" determines the

fraction of the total mass flux associated with each cloud. Thus, in theory, the method is able to distinguish the

type of convection in a variety of regimes. In the tropics the ensemble would be dominated by deep convection,

while in the subtropical trade-wind regions shallow convective cloud would dominate the ensemble. When using

a bulk scheme, only one cloud type is present in each grid box of a model and so some a priori decision must be

made as to the type of convection present, allowing the lateral mixing properties and the estimation of cloud-base

mass flux to be varied depending upon whether the convection is dominated by deep or shallow convection. For

example, shallow convection is smaller and more turbulent that deep convection and so will have a higher entrain-

ment rate than deep convection.

Such "switching" is usually done on the basis of an aspect of the large-scale environment in which the convection

is growing. For example, observations show that deep convection is often collocated with regions of moisture con-

vergence, while shallow convection is found to occur under low-level inversions caused by large-scale subsidence,

where the moisture supply to the planetary boundary layer is dominated by evaporation from the surface. Thus in

the Tiedtke scheme used at ECMWF, if the large-scale convergence of moisture into a column is larger than the

surface evaporation then convection is deemed to be deep and a low entrainment rate set for the purpose of estimat-

ing the ascent of a parcel, and hence its in-cloud properties. If the converse is so, then higher entrainment rates are

set appropriate to shallow convection (being four times larger than those used for deep convection).



The mass-flux approach to the parametrization of deep convection

10 Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series

 ECMWF, 2002

5.2 (b)  Formulation of entrainment and detrainment. A further issue with the bulk approach is the specifica-

tion of entrainment and detrainment rates. Simulations made by GCMs show a large degree of sensitivity to these

quantities (see paper on "Sensitivity of GCM performance to convective parametrization” and Yao and DelGeno

(1989)). Cloud-top height is very sensitive to the magnitude of the entrainment rate. With only one plume present

the entrainment rate must be set so as to allow the maximum cloud-top height to be correctly estimated. Also, ac-

count has to be taken of those clouds which, in reality, detrain at levels lower than this height. This is usually done

by including a background detrainment rate in addition to that which occurs at the top of the plume. For the Tiedtke

scheme in cases of deep convection, entrainment is applied below the level of the maxima in large-scale vertical

velocity, while a fixed (so-called "mixing") detrainment rate is applied throughout the cloud depth. The depth and

magnitude of the terminal detrainment near cloud top is estimated by the decrease in parcel kinetic energy caused

by the overshoot of a parcel above its neutral buoyancy level. This ad hoc approach matches the shape of the mass-

flux profile with that of the grid-scale motion, generally a feature observed in deep convective regions. In the case

of shallow convection the entrainment and mixing detrainment rates are equal and constant with height, implying

a constant mass flux above cloud base until the parcel becomes negatively buoyant.

In recent years the validity of the entraining/detraining plume cloud model widely used in mass-flux schemes has

been questioned. Raymond and Blyth (1986) studying cumulus clouds suggested that mixing across the cloud

boundary occurs episodically rather than continually, with parcels of air that become negatively buoyant on mixing

descending to their level of neutral buoyancy before leaving the cloud. Schemes discussed by Kain and Fritsch

(1990) and Emanuel (1991) have incorporated simplified versions of this model into convection schemes for use

with meso-scale and climate models. Nordeng (1994) has also suggested a revised specification of entrainment

rates for the ECMWF convection scheme for use within the frame work of the entrainment/detraining plume ap-

proach, with entrainment rates linked to the buoyancy of the parcel.

5.3  Performance of "cloud ensemble" and "bulk schemes"

Although the bulk cloud model approach is simpler than the Arakawa–Schubert scheme, it performs well in both

climate and NWP applications. Fig. 6 shows December/January/February precipitation averaged over the 10 years

of the AMIP decade (1979–1988) (Slingo et al. 1996) simulated by a version of the ECMWF model (T42, 19 levels)

using a version of the Tiedtke scheme and the GLA model ( , 11 levels) which employs a version of the

Arakawa–Schubert scheme. An observed climatology derived from satellite observations (Spencer 1993), estimat-

ed from microwave sounding unit (MSU) data) is also shown. Differences to the climatology are seen but both

models give a reasonable estimate of the distribution of precipitation. The ECMWF simulation has stronger pre-

cipitation over the west Pacific and the Pacific ITCZ, but underestimates rainfall in the SPCZ. The GLA model

overemphasises the SPCZ and underestimates the rainfall north of the equator in the Pacific.

(1993) derived from MSU data (adapted from Slingo et al. (1996)).

5.4  Representation of downdraughts

As discussed above, downdraughts play a large role in the convective heat budget. In parametrizations these are

usually modelled by an inverted entraining plume starting near the level of minimum equivalent potential temper-

ature in the mid troposphere. The magnitude of the downdraught mass flux has to be determined. Some schemes

estimate the activity of the downdraught from empirical relationships between observed precipitation efficiency



The mass-flux approach to the parametrization of deep convection

and the vertical shear of the horizontal wind (Fritsch and Chappel 1980). In the Tiedtke scheme a simpler approach

is used, the initial mass flux at the top of the plume being set to a third of the of the updraught mass flux at cloud

base. As air descends it is cooled by the evaporation, maintaining negative buoyancy, and finally detrains into the

subcloud layer which it tends to cool and dry. One weakness with current schemes is that they often assume that

evaporation of precipitation within the downdraught maintains saturation, whereas observations suggest that they

remain unsaturated (Betts 1973).  This may cause errors in the subcloud-layer budgets of heat and moisture.

5.5  Estimation of cloud base mass flux

For mass-flux parametrization schemes, the closure problem is essentially the need to estimate the convective mass

flux at the base of the cloud. This determines the magnitude of the convective heat release while the cloud model,

and associated cloud microphysical parametrization used, determines how this heat is distributed in the vertical.

No exact theory exists for the closure problem and several different methods have been used. Howeve, it is possible

to broadly classify these various closures into "dynamical" and "adjustment" types.

5.5 (a)  Dynamical closure. "Dynamical" closures relate the cloud-base mass flux to the large-scale forcing

and atmospheric structure, usually making some assumption regarding the "quasi-equilibrium" of the convecting

atmosphere. The closure of the Arakawa and Schubert (1974) scheme is of this type, relating convective activity

to large-scale forcing throughout the depth of the convecting layer. The Tiedtke (1989) scheme estimates cloud-

base mass flux from an equilibrium assumption on either moisture (for deep convection) or moist static energy (for

shallow convection) integrated over the subcloud layer. Such a closure relates to the ideas of boundary-layer quasi-

equilibrium put forward by Raymond (1995) .

Integrating over the subcloud layer, and assuming that there is a balance between convection and other processes

(surface fluxes, turbulence, large-scale motion), then

(18)

where , , and are the updraught and downdraught mass flux and mixing ratios, is the forcing

due to surface fluxes, turbulence and large-scale motion and is the height of cloud base. Quantities with the

subscript refer to their values at cloud base. As the downdraught mass flux is related to the updraught mass flux

at cloud base, Eq. (18) can be rearranged to give an estimate for the cloud-base mass flux.

5.5 (b)  Adjustment closure. In schemes which use an "adjustment" closure, the cloud-base mass flux is calcu-

lated from relaxing the large-scale atmosphere back to an equilibrium structure. The Fritsch and Chappel (1980)

scheme provides an example of this type of closure, where the cloud-base mass flux is calculated from the reduction

of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) over a time scale .

CAPE is defined as

(ignoring virtual effects for simplicity).

Approximating by a subsidence term, and assuming that convection reduces CAPE to zero over a timescale

, the cloud-base mass flux is given by,

(21)

where  is the mass flux i.e.  is the mass flux normalised by its value at cloud base.

The time scale for adjustment is resolution dependent due to the magnitude of the resolved vertical velocity on

small horizontal scales increasing as resolution decreases (Nordeng 1994). If a quasi-equilibrium is assumed to

exist then moistening due to large-scale ascent is approximately balanced by compensating subsidence implying

that

(22)

In general, the resolved magnitude of the vertical velocity roughly doubles as the horizontal grid length is halved,

implying that the time scale for adjustment must decrease as resolution increases.

6. EVALUATION OF CONVECTION SCHEMES USING CLOUD RESOLVING MODELS

It has already been shown that the bulk mass-flux approach to convective parametrization is able to provide a broad-

ly comparable distribution of global precipitation to that obtained through the use of more complex scheme (Fig.

6 ). The development of cloud-resolving models with the ability to capture accurately features of convective clouds

allows more detailed evaluation of the realism of the representation of convection afforded by the mass-flux ap-

proach. Quantities such as updraught and downdraught mass flux are poorly specified by observations but are read-

ily diagnosed from cloud-resolving models, providing a powerful tool to evaluate the assumptions used to generate

these key quantities.

Here mass fluxes estimated from the Tiedtke convection scheme in a single-column version of the ECMWF fore-

cast model are compared with those estimated by cloud-resolving models (CRMs) for three different cases;

(a) tropical convection during GATE. Constant cooling and moistening tendencies representing the

effects of large-scale ascent are provided to the model and surface fluxes and sensible and latent

heat (12 and 145 W m-2) respectively are held constant

(b) convection in a cold-air out break forced by surface fluxes only (sensible- and latent-heat fluxes of

123 and 492 W m-2, respectively)

(c) shallow convection during BOMEX (based upon a case study of Holland and Rasmusson (1973))

Further details of cases (a) and (b) are presented in Kershaw et al. (1997) and Gregory et al. (1997), while the

BOMEX case is discussed by Siebesma and Holtslag (1996). The convection scheme is as used in CY14R3 of the

ECMWF model. The closure of the scheme differs from that described above in that only updraught fluxes of mois-

ture out of the boundary layer are considered to balance the forcing in the subcloud layer. This does not affect the

average properties of convection over the 10 hour period of experiments (a) and (b), the convection scheme being

in balance with the forcing supplied to the model. However the evolution of the convective heating is changed and

this will be illustrated for the GATE case.  Case (c) is unaffected by this change as no downdraughts form.

For the GATE case (Fig. 7 : 10 hour average), the depth of the updraught is overestimated implying that the en-

trainment rates specified may be too low. Updraught mass flux is underestimated by 25% in the lowest 4 km, par-

tially compensated by too weak a downdraught compared with that diagnosed from the CRM. The decrease in

mass flux above 5 km is reasonably captured by the detrainment rate specified. The evolution of precipitation for

this case is shown in Fig. 8 , where the impact of including the downdraughts into the estimation of cloud-base

mass flux is illustrated (Fig. 8 (b)). Without downdraughts (Fig. 8 (a)) the convective response becomes intermit-

tent, the amount of precipitation released in individual convective events being much larger than the moisture sup-

ply to the model. Between periods of intense deep convection shallow convection occurs, contributing to the large

mass flux at cloud base seen in Fig. 7 .

Figure  7. Comparison of convective mass fluxes for updraught and downdraughts predicted by the Tiedtke

convection scheme (UD : solid/DD : dot-dash) and diagnosed from a cloud resolving model simulation (UD :

dash/ DD : triple dot-dash) for convection in a GATE easterly wave (10-hour averages).

Such behaviour is caused by updraughts balancing the moisture supply in the subcloud layer, leaving downdraughts

to dry the layer and so stabilise the profile with respect to deep convection. With downdraughts included the re-

sponse of the convection is steady, the precipitation amount being in quasi-equilibrium with the moisture supplied

to the model. The magnitude of updraught mass flux near cloud base is reduced as deep convection occurs through

the entire simulation, although above 2 km the mass-flux structure is similar to that in Fig. 7 .

For the cold-air outbreak case (Fig. 9 : 10 hour average) the moisture convergence into the column is zero, apart

from surface evaporation and the switching described above sets the plume parameters to those appropriate to shal-

low convection even though, from the CRM simulation, it is clear that the convection is deep. With large entrain-

ment rates the depth of convection is underestimated and large detrainment rates cause the mass flux, which is over-

estimated at the base of the cloud, to fall too rapidly with height. This case points out a deficiency in the switching

mechanism used to determine whether convection is deep or shallow. It should be noted that forcing the scheme

to use the deep-convective values for entrainment and detrainment produces an updraught mass-flux profile that is

in better agreement with that of the CRM.

The mass-flux approach to the parametrization of deep convection

The BOMEX case (Fig. 10 : average between 12 and 36 hours) is one in which the large-scale motion above a low-

level inversion is downward, and so rightly the convection scheme determines that this is a case of shallow convec-

tion. The CRM simulation suggests that mass flux reduced with height across the cloud layer, implying that de-

trainment rates are larger than entrainment rates. With the Tiedtke scheme the cloud-base mass flux is

underestimated and, due to entrainment and detrainment rates being equal, does not changed with height until the

inversion layer when an additional "terminal" detrainment occurs as the ascending parcels’ vertical kinetic energy

decreases. Increasing entrainment rates by a factor of 2 and detrainment rates by a factor of 3, roughly matching

those diagnosed from the CRM, gives a larger cloud-base mass flux and a profile that better matches that of the

CRM (Fig. 10 : dotted curve). Siebesma and Holtslag (1996) found a similar sensitivity using an earlier version

of the Tiedtke convection scheme. With increased entrainment and detrainment rates the thermodynamic structure

is also closer to that observed during BOMEX.

version with increased entrainment and detrainment rates (dotted) and diagnosed from a cloud-resolving model

7. CONCLUDING COMMENTS

This paper has outlined the theoretical basis of mass-flux convection schemes and described how this is applied in

practice, concentrating upon a class of parametrizations based around the "bulk" cloud model approach of Yanai

et al. (1973). This method is simpler than the spectral approach, such as in the Arakawa–Schubert scheme, but

gives reasonable estimates of global precipitation patterns in GCMs. This type of scheme depends upon correct a

priori decisions being made as to the dominant nature of convection at a grid point and its internal characteristics.

Using the Tiedtke scheme, the ability of these type of schemes to represent convection in a variety of circumstances

has been commented upon through comparison with cloud-resolving model simulations. This identifies areas

where modification is required, such as the "switching" criteria to distinguish deep and shallow convective cases,

together with the entrainment rates used. Future studies of a variety of convective regimes will be useful to improve

the representation of such processes in parametrizations.
