Preface 

The current Note covers material presented in the Training course lectures I-IV on “atmospheric moist 

convection and its parameterization”, and further elaborates on other subjects like the diurnal cycle of 

convection, numerics and the momentum and tracer transport by convection. The aim is to give an 

overview of convective phenomena and their links with synoptic meteorology, and to provide the basic 

concepts and parametrization and modelling tools. Of course, not all phenomena could be treated, as e.g. 

phenomena like monsoon circulations and tropical storms.  

The material presented should be easily accessible to beginners in the field, but should also be of interest 

for people more advanced, and those interested in diverse areas like cloud resolving modelling, and 

weather forecasting. The references to research articles are certainly not exhaustive, and the reader 

interested in specific subjects is encouraged to find more references in the cited articles or refer to

1 The nature of moist convection 

1.1 Introduction 

For a definition of convection we can go back to the principal of Archimedes (260, b.C.) saying that a body 

immersed in a fluid will be driven upward by a force equal to the difference between its weight and the 

weight of the fluid displaced. Here we will mainly deal with moist convection, i.e. upward and downward 

motions (“thermals”) that are associated with moist air and water phase changes (clouds). “Dry” 

convection, e.g. boundary layer convection is dealt with in the “boundary-layer” course, even if it is also of 

interest to us as “dry” convection might give raise to “moist” convection. 

As an example, typical convective cloud systems are identified on an infrared satellite image from 7 April 

2003 (Figure 1.1), deep and shallow convection in the midlatitudes and subtropics, tropical convection in 

the inner tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), tropical mesoscale convective systems (so called squall lines) 

over land , stratocumulus clouds over the cold waters off the west coasts of Africa and off the west coasts 

of the continents in general, and convection associated with other prominent convergence zones, here the 

South Atlantic convergence zone. These cloud systems are forced by radiative effects, surface fluxes and 

synoptic and large-scale circulations, but also strongly impact on the larger-scales through the radiative 

effects and in particular through the net release of latent heat in deep precipitating convective systems. 

However, not only the amount of (convective) precipitation in the Tropics is much larger than in higher 

latitudes, also the response and forcing differ. Therefore, in the following midlatitude and tropical 

convection are treated separately.

typical deep and shallow convective cloud systems.

1.2 Tropical Meteorology and Climate 

An analysis of the global energy cycle shows that convection is the main physical process that generates 

kinetic energy in the atmosphere (Steinheimer et al. 2008). The net release of heat (precipitation that 

reaches the ground) in deep convection implies a perturbation to the atmosphere that must be evacuated. 

This occurs via fast propagating gravity waves (typically with speeds on the order of 30 m s-1), similar to 

what is happening when a stone is thrown in a lake. A detailed description of the adjustment process and 

the wave equations cannot be given here - the interested reader is referred to a few examples for the 

(wave-like) adjustment process (return to equilibrium) that are provided in the Appendix - further 

recommended articles are Bretherton and Smolarkiewicz (1989), Mapes (1997), Sobel et al. (2001) or Eitzen 

and Randall (2005). However, the fundamental difference between the Tropics and the midlatitudes resides 

in the radius of influence over which this perturbation spreads, which is given by the Rossby radius Ro=N H 

f -1, where N, the Brunt Väisälä frequency (N2 =gθ-1 dθ/dz, with g the gravitational constant, and θ the 

potential temperature) is a measure of the vertical stability, f is the Coriolis parameter, and H  the 

tropopause height. As in the Tropics f tends to zero Ro tends to infinity, which means that perturbations in 

the Tropics affect the whole tropical belt, whereas Ro in midlatitudes is on the order of a few thousand 

kilometers  (f~10-4s-1, H=8-15 km,  N~0.1 s-1, g=9.81 m s-2). We still have a lot to learn about the interaction 

of convective perturbations with the larger-scale circulations (“the chicken and egg”) using observations 

high-resolution large-domain numerical simulations of tropical convection together with “spectral” analysis

methods (e.g. Grist 2002; Grabowski 2003; Yano et al. 2005, Nasuno et al. 2006, Lin et al. 2008). In 

particular, Shutts (2008) and Herman et al. (2016) “isolated” Kelvin waves and demonstrated the 

interaction (energy conversion) of convection with the large-scale wave through a positive correlation 

between the convective heating in the upper-troposphere and the positive temperature anomaly of the 

wave. Here only a description of the main meridional and zonal circulations is given. 

1.2.1 Precipitation and radiative convective equilibrium 

The global annual distribution of rainfall for 2000/2001 from the GPCP project (a combination of satellite 

derived rainfall rates and surface observations) and those from a one-year integration of the ECMWF 

Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) are depicted in Figure 1.2. The global average daily rainfall rate is 

around 3 mm day-1, but most of the precipitation occurs in the tropical belt with a rate of 5-7 mm day-1. The 

dry subtropical anticyclonical areas to the west of the continents are also apparent as well as the 

midlatitude storm tracks. 

It might appear counterintuitive, but the tropical convection is driven by the radiative (clear sky) cooling of 

the atmosphere which together with warm sea surface temperatures or surface heating over land provides 

the necessary vertical destabilization of the troposphere for convection to occur. Note that a cooling rate of 

2 K day-1 in the lowest 15 km of the troposphere corresponds to a surface precipitation rate of 5 mm day-1. 

The radiative convective equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 1.3, where the profiles of the different physical 

tendencies (radiation, dynamics, convection, clouds, and boundary-layer diffusion) averaged over the 

tropical belt 20°N-20°S have been obtained from the IFS. The distinction between clouds, convection and 

boundary-layer diffusion is somewhat arbitrary as these tendencies are only available through 

parameterization, but the main point is that there is on average a radiative cooling of 1-2 K day-1 that is 

balanced by strong heating from precipitating convection and dynamical cooling, which represents the 

ascending branch of the Hadley cell. For humidity there is drying of the free troposphere (above 850 hPa) 

by convective precipitation and moistening by dynamical ascent, whereas the moisture in the boundary-

layer has been evaporated over sea and advected from the subtropics.

the tropical belt between 20N-20S. Dyn denotes the dynamical tendency (horizontal + vertical 
advection), Diff the contribution from the boundary-layer diffusion scheme, Conv the contribution from 
shallow and deep convection, Cloud the large-scale condensation/evaporation processes, and Rad the 
radiation, the black line corresponds to the sum of all individual contributions.

1.2.2 Cloud distributions 

The global distribution of convective clouds can be inferred from satellite observations. As a proxy for these 

observations the annual frequency of occurrence of deep convective clouds (defined as having a thickness 

exceeding 200 hPa and positive buoyancy) and shallow convective clouds (defined as “convective” -

meaning is explained later) but having a thickness < 200 hPa) as obtained from the IFS convection 

parameterization are shown in Figure 1.4. A comparison of these distributions with independent satellite 

observations measuring e.g. the liquid water path (SSMI), the radiation budget (CERES) etc. shows that the 

distributions in Figure 1.4 are reasonable, and certainly sufficient for the main points we wish to make: 

deep convective clouds are a prominent feature of the tropical belt, whereas shallow convective clouds are 

an ubiquitous feature of the subtropical anti-cyclonic regions, where they are called “trade wind cumuli”.

obtained  with  IFS Cy40r1. 

Trade wind cumulus 

As shallow convective clouds are already extensively treated in the “Boundary-Layer Course”, the detailed 

processes that lead to their formation will not be treated in this Course. Instead, a brief discussion is 

included here about trade wind cumulus in the context of large-scale equilibrium. In Figure 1.5 are depicted 

the different layers that compose the troposphere in the subtropics, i.e. the subcloud layer, the cloud layer, 

the inversion layer, and the free troposphere. In the troposphere there is equilibrium between clear sky 

radiative cooling and subsidence, in the inversion layer subsidence warming compensates evaporative 

cooling at cloud tops, whereas in the cloud layer mean subsidence and “cumulus induced subsidence” (this 

term will be explained thoroughly later in the course) balance radiative cooling that mainly occurs in the 

clear sky part of the domain - trade wind cumuli generally occupy less than 10% of the domain. Finally, in 

the subcloud layer there is balance between the surface heat fluxes and the heat flux out of the subcloud 

layer.

Emmanuel) 

Three modes of convection 

Actually one can distinguish three prominent modes of convection (Figure 1.6), shallow convection that 

penetrates to the trade inversion layer or, more generally, to the boundary-layer inversion layer, deep 

precipitating convection that reaches the tropopause or some tropopause inversion layer, and cumulus 

congestus that penetrate to the melting layer, a thin stable layer at the zero degree isotherm (in the Tropics 

located around 500 hPa) that is maintained by melting of ice phase precipitation. As discussed in numerous 

studies (e.g. Johnson et al. 1999, Redelsperger et al. 2002), cumulus congestus can make up to 50% of all 

convective clouds over the tropical Western Pacific. Therefore, they play an important role in the overall 

energy and mass budget, but also in a moistening = preconditioning of the middle troposphere for 

subsequent deep convective events. As in tropical regions shallow cumulus and cumulus congestus 

generally do not penetrate the zero-degree isotherm, their dynamical and microphysical properties 

necessarily differ from that of deep convective clouds.

1.3 Tropical Circulations 

1.3.1 The Hadley and Walker circulation 

The most prominent tropical meridional circulation is named after the 18th century Englishman George 

Hadley.  As already mentioned it has its ascending branch over the ITCZ (which typically is at 5-10°N over 

the Pacific Ocean, but strongly migrates over the continents) and its descending branch over the subtropics. 

As the deep Tropics land and water masses absorb the majority of the solar energy of the globe and 

transfer it to the atmosphere, and the infrared energy radiated back to space varies only little with latitude, 

a meridional temperature gradient exists, and heat must be exported from the Tropics to the higher 

latitudes. This is the thermally direct Hadley cell. But keep in mind that this description is simplistic as we 

have not mentioned the dynamic (geostrophic) constraints on this circulation. An idealized picture of the 

Hadley circulation is illustrated in Figure 1.7 showing a cross section over the Pacific with the rising and 

descending branches of the Hadley cell, the associated increase of the cloud top height toward the Equator 

with increasing sea surface temperature and decreasing subsidence, and the low-level return flow from the 

subtropics to the Tropics in the boundary-layer. An estimate of the magnitude of the subsiding motion 

above the boundary-layer in the subsiding branch of the Hadley cell can be obtained assuming an 

equilibrium between radiative cooling and heating by subsidence: w dθ/dz = dθ/dt_rad. With dθ/dt_rad=- 

1-2 K day-1 (Figure 1.3), and dθ/dz~0.5 K/100 m, one obtains w~ -0.5 cm s-1. 

 

 

Figure 1.7: Schematic NE-SW cross section over the northeastern Pacific or Atlantic from 40N to the 
Equator showing the characteristic increase of cloud top height and boundary-layer inversion height 
with increasing sea surface temperatures and decreasing subsidence. The deep tropical cumulus clouds 
denote the ascending branch of the Hadley cell, shallow cumuli and stratocumulus clouds can be found 
in the descending branch. 

However, the pattern of convection in the equatorial regions exhibits strong departures from zonal 

symmetry. This was recognized by G. T. Walker who explained the particular significance of the east-west 

overturning along the Equator (Figure 1.8), and in particular between the Indonesia region, where under 

normal condition most of the rainfall occurs (see also Figure 1.2), and the eastern Pacific. The migration of 

the ascending branch and associated deep convection to the east (El Niño phase) is related to sea-surface 

temperature variations by wind-driven ocean currents.

1988) 

1.3.2 Tropical Waves 

Taking a spectral view of the tropical motions, one can identify wave motions, so called convectively 

coupled waves that are eastward and westward propagating disturbances trapped about the Equator. The 

existence of these waves can be shown analytically using e.g. the linearised momentum and continuity 

equations in Cartesian coordinates on a β-plane (the Coriolis parameter varies in the latitudinal=y 

direction), specifying the mean horizontal motion u, setting the mean meridional motion v  to zero, and 

searching for the solution of the perturbation velocity v’ which generally will be a function of wavenumber 

k and frequency  . Recall that waves are dispersive if   is a function of k, where k  is the phase speed, 

and k   the group speed, i.e. the speed with which the wave energy propagates. The reader interested 

in a detailed derivation of these equations, the specific dispersion relations, and the stability criteria for 

damped or growing wave motion is referred to e.g. Holton (pp. 394 ff.), Cho and Pendlebury (1997), Verkley 

and van der Velde (2010); for an identification of these waves from satellite data and analysis the reader is 

referred to Wheeler and Kiladis (1999), Yang et al. (2003), and Cho et al. (2004), Žagar et al. (2005). The 

forcing of stationary wave motion by diabatic heating is explained in Simmons (1982). Experimentally one 

can identify tropical waves from satellite observations, mainly the outgoing long-wave radiation, and 

analysed wind and height fields, after having subtracted the background field (or “noise”) via appropriate 

filtering methods. A few simple techniques to derive linear wave types and practical examples are provided 

in the Appendix. 

1.3.3 The equatorial Kelvin and Rossby wave 

Among the most important equatorial wave types are the Kelvin and the Rossby wave as illustrated in 

Figure 1.9. The Kelvin wave is a Gaussian function centred on the Equator with a positive (eastward) phase 

speed of about 18 m s-1. As can be seen from Figure 1.9a the Kelvin wave is 50% rotational and 50% 

divergent, and forms some eastward propagating dipole like a shallow water gravity wave.  

The equatorial Rossby wave (Figure 1.9b) is a westward propagating wave with a phase speed of around 5 

m s-1, and is also symmetric to the Equator. Its kinetic energy is larger than the potential energy, with the 

kinetic energy being at maximum at the Equator and the potential energy being at maximum off the 

equator.

These waves (modes) can be extracted from real data by either using a filtering in the wavenumber 

frequency domain (e.g. Wheeler and Kiladis (1999), this however requires long time series, or by projection 

of the 3D data at a given time onto the normal modes as developed by  Žagar et al. (2015) . Results from 

the latter method are displayed in   Figure 1.9c showing the ECMWF analysis of the horizontal wind and 

geopotential at 850 hPa and its decomposition into the zonal wave number 1 Kelvin mode and the zonal 

wave number 1-2 rotational (Rossby) modes. Interestingly, a strong MJO (see next paragraph) is present in 

the equatorial West Pacific which seems to be dominated by the Rossby modes. 

All these modes are an integral part of the Hadley and Walker circulations.

1.3.4 African easterly waves 

A very distinct type of tropical waves occurs over Africa, in particular north of the Equator between June 

and October, the so called African easterly waves. This wave type is very important as most of the 

precipitation in West and Sub-Saharan Africa is associated with mesoscale convective systems forced by 

these waves (Mohr and Thorncroft, 2006). African easterly waves have periods of 2-6 days, typical 

wavelengths of about 2500 km and westward propagation speeds around 8 m s-1 (Diedhiou et al. 1999, 

Grist 2002, Nicholson and Grist 2003, Hsieh and Cook, 2005). The particularity of the tropical meteorology 

in Africa is the existence of a Jet stream in boreal summer at around 600-700 hPa, the African Easterly Jet 

(AEJ), between the humid and relatively cool equatorial regions and the very hot and dry Sahara. It 

therefore results from the thermal wind balance in response to the strong meridional temperature 

gradient.  Note that due to small temperature gradients (typically <1 K/1000 km) the tropical regions are 

generally void of Jet streams, with the notable exceptions of a weak low-level Jet over South America, and 

an upper-tropospheric Jet around 100-200 hPa between India and Africa, the Tropcial Easterly Jet (TEJ). The 

TEJ forms in the outflow region of the Indian Monsoon as a result of quasi-geostrophic adjustment (the 

adjustment of the geostrophic wind and height field to the convective heating). The African easterly waves 

are thought to form as a result of the barotropic and baroclinic instability of the Jet, where barotropic 

represents the meridional shear of the Jet and baroclinic the vertical shear of the Jet - like in midlatitude 

synoptic perturbations. The instability condition for the AEJ (see references given above) requires the 

quasi-potential vorticity ξ gradient to become negative

where U  is the mean zonal wind, β represents the meridional variation of the Coriolis parameter, f is  the 

Coriolis parameter at a given latitude, and S a stability parameter ; ξ is thoroughly explained in Section 1.4. 

Luckily, one can visualise African wave activity from analysis or forecasts without filtering. In Figure 1.10 are 

plotted the mean sea level pressure, the meridional velocity v for 29 September 2005 18UTC, as well as the 

precipitation in the previous 6 hours from an 18h operational forecast. One clearly identifies the Saharan 

heat low, the undulations in the wind and pressure field between 10 and 18°N, as well as the precipitation 

systems south of these undulations. As shown in Figure 1.11 the waves and their zonal propagation are

alternatively the OLR. The ECMWF analysis between 10 August 2005 and 9 September 2005 has been used 

and all fields are averaged over latitudes 5°S-20°N. The waves in Figure 1.11 originate near 20°E or 0°E, and 

with typical periods of 4 days, and westward propagation speeds between 7-10 m s-1, they correspond to 

the classical picture of Rossby-type waves and are called African easterly waves. 

1.3.5 Tropical waves and the MJO  

The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) identified by Madden and Julian (1971)- see the review paper by 

Zhang (2005) as well as Matthews (2008), and Vitart and Molteni (2010) for a more thorough description 

and teleconnections)- is a massive area of convection composed of several tropical wave types, often 

developing in the Indian Ovean and then propagating eastward at a speed of roughly 5 m s-1. The MJO is 

strictly not an oscillation as it can be sporadic, but has maximum spectral power in the 20-80 day frequency 

range. A strong MJO observed on 27 November 2011 is shown in  

Figure 1.12, where are also superposed in  a schematic way the characteristic Equator symmetric wind 

gyres at 850 and 200 hPa, given by the ECMWF analysis. As a result of these gyres strong low-level 

westerlies occur behind the area of main convection whereas easterly inflow occurs ahead of the 

convection.

to the West, with low-level westerly flow 
behind and easterly flow ahead, and these 
gyres are in an idealised case counter rotating 
– but in the present case the low-level dashed 
gyre pair also  showed positive vorticity.

Finally, a convenient way to analyse all tropical waves/oscillations consists in computing so called 

wavenumber-frequency diagrams (Wheeler and Kiladis 1999) with the aid of a double discrete Fourier 

transform over time and space. The practical difficulty however, consists in subtracting an appropriate 

reference wave spectrum in order to filter out the significant modes. Typical variables analysed with this 

method are the Outgoing Longwave Radition (OLR which is also available from satellite observations), the 

wind components or the smoother fields of the velocity potential and/or the streamfunction which are the 

inverse Laplacian of the divergence and the vorticity, respectively. The wavenumber-frequency diagram for 

the tropical OLR from NOAA satellite is depicted in Figure 1.13a . The westward propagating Rossby modes 

and eastward propagating Kelvin modes become easily apparent. The maximum amplitude of the eastward 

propagating modes is at wavenumbers one and two, and with frequencies between 20 and 60 days this 

signal is often referred to as the MJO. 

Figures 1.13b,c show the corresponding wave-number frequency spectra from an ensemble of 1-year T159 

integrations with the IFS cycles 31r1 (2006) and Cy38r1 (2012/13).  Until 2007 the IFS had problems in 

simulating the tropical wave spectra and in particular the eastward propagating Kelvin waves and the MJO. 

However, since cycle 32R3 (operational 6 November 2007) that contains revisions to the convection 

parametrization (entrainment and closure in Bechtold et al. 2008a,b ) the IFS is  able (Figure 1.13c) to 

realistically represent the wave spectra, in particular it reduces the amplitude of the Rossby waves and now 

also represents the eastward propagating Kelvin waves and the MJO. 

1.3.6 Summary of tropical motions and scales 

There are still uncertainties concerning our knowledge about the interaction between convective and 

synoptic scales in the Tropics. 

Horizontal temperature fluctuations in the Tropics are small <1K/1000 km; and in the absence of 

precipitation the vertical motions (subsidence) tend to balance the cooling through infrared radiation loss: 
1 1     1 2 K day  0 5 cm s/ / _ ~ .w d dz d dt rad w         . 

• In the absence of condensation heating, tropical motions must be barotropic (density variations are 

only a function of pressure and not of temperature) and cannot convert potential energy in kinetic 

energy. Therefore they must be driven by precipitating disturbances or lateral coupling with 

midlatitude systems. 

• When precipitation takes place, heating rates are strong; e.g. 100 mm day-1 precipitation 

correspond to an energy flux of 2900 W m-2 or an average 30 K day-1 heating of the atmospheric 

column, implying an ascent rate w ~ 8.6 cm s-1. However, this positive mean motion is composed of 

strong ascent of order w~1 m s-1 in the Cumulus updrafts and slow descending motion around 

(“compensating subsidence”). 

• When analysing the vorticity equation it appears that in precipitating disturbances the vertical 

transport of vorticity (momentum) through Cumulus is important to balance the divergence term. 

On average, cumulus convection tends to slow down the horizontal winds what is often called 

“cumulus friction”, where horizontal momentum is conserved, but not kinetic energy.

1.4 Midlatitude Convection and its synoptic and orographic forcing   

The title obviously implies that midlatitude precipitating convection is synoptically forced which is certainly 

not the whole truth, but a good starting point. The reason is that the occurrence of intense precipitating 

convection requires the continuous conversion of potential energy in kinetic energy of the convective 

draughts, where the potential energy can only be supplied by continuous large-scale destabilization (lifting) 

of the atmosphere, or to a smaller extent by strong surface fluxes, e.g. when very cold air is advected over 

warm seas. 

A climatology of central southern European rainfall as provided by Frei and Schär (1998) indicates that most 

intense precipitation with values above 3 mm day-1 or 1000 mm year-1 occurs in the vicinity of high 



Atmospheric Moist Convection  
 

 

 

Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 17 

 

orography, especially around the Mediterranean (Figure 1.14a). A large part of the precipitation in these 

regions is due to synoptically forced mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), in particular during autumn. A 

study by Morel and Sénési (2001) using infrared satellite imagery to identify the regions where deep 

convective systems, covering a certain area, form (are “triggered”) confirms the role of the orography. 

However, intense convection only occurs under favourable synoptic conditions, where the orography only 

provides some additional lifting or elevated heating to overcome possible stable layers near cloud base (see 

later discussion in Section 1.5).

mesoscale convective systems as obtained from 
satellite infrared imagery by Morel and Sénési 
(2001). 

The synoptic forcing of convection in midlatitudes can be described with the aid of two concepts, the 

potential vorticity (PV), and the Jets and associated circulations. Both concepts/quantities also prove 

extremely useful for forecasters in identifying and forecasting convective activity on synoptic charts. The 

concept of PV defined as 

   ,PV f
P





 


 (1.2) 

where ξ is the relative vorticity, has first been developed by C. Gustav Rossby and colleagues in 1938, and 

later extended by Hoskins et al. (1985). PV has the following useful properties: i) it is conserved in 

frictionless and adiabatic motion, where on constant θ surfaces it is advected like a passive tracer, and ii) its 

field shows more structure than the more “traditional” but equivalent approach of considering the 

geopotentiel height on constant pressure surfaces.  

An upper-tropospheric positive vorticity anomaly, typical for northern hemispheric synoptic perturbations 

is illustrated in Figure 1.15. As we know from synoptic meteorology there is ascent (positive vorticity 

advection, ascending branch of ageostrophic circulation) to the east of the trough (Figure 1.15a), and 

therefore a favorable area for convective forcing. But also, as seen from Figure 1.15 the region below the 

anomaly (“inside the trough”) has a less stable stratification with relatively warm air in the lower layers and 

relatively cold air in the mid- and upper troposphere. Therefore, in spite of weaker dynamical forcing this 

region will also be favorable for convective development, especially in the presence of strong surface fluxes 

over relatively warm ocean waters.

PV anomalies are often associated with Jets. However, it is important to consider separately the strong 

forcing that Jet dynamics associated with the thermal wind balance or horizontal temperature gradient 

provide for convection. A Jet stream with colder air to the left and warmer air to the right of its axes is 

depicted in Figure 1.16. Furthermore, the ageostrophic vertical circulations at the entrance and exit region 

of the Jet have also been depicted. These can be simply explained as follows: at the entrance/exit region of 

the Jet an acceleration/deceleration takes places which is given by the ageostrophic wind: 

 g adu dt f v v fv   ,  where  u  is the wind component along the Jet axes, and av  is the  ageostrophic 

wind perpendicular to the Jet axes. Another interesting explanation is to interpret the ageostrophic 

circulations as the conversion of potential energy in kinetic energy of the Jet in the entrance region, and 

from kinetic energy in potential energy in the exit region. The two ascending branches of the ageostrophic 

circulations (marked by + signs in Figure 1.16), i.e. the right entrance region and the left exit region of the 

Jet constitute favourable regions for deep convection to occur. However, the strongest forcing of 

convection occurs in the left exit region, where the ageostrophic circulation is thermally direct, i.e. from 

warm to cold at low levels.

where the thick solid line can be considered as a PV isocontour and the tropopause height. (Adapted

The forcing mechanisms of midlatitude deep convection discussed so far should become clearer when 

looking at case studies of convective events. Two severe deep convective events are shown in Figure 1.17, 

one that occurred over south-eastern France 9 September 2002 bringing 800 mm rain in 24 h (Figure 1.17a, 

b), and one that occurred over central North America 5 June 2003 and was associated with several MSCs 

producing Tornadic storms (Figure 1.17c,d). Infrared satellite images have been overlaid with analysis of PV

In both cases there is a strong PV anomaly or PV “streamer” with an upper-level Jet at the western flank of 

the anomaly. Furthermore, in both cases the southern dip of the anomaly coincided with the exit region of 

a weak subtropical Jet in Figure 1.17a, and a very strong subtropical Jet in Figure 1.17c. The intense 

convection organized in MSCs forms at the south-eastern flank of the anomaly below the upper-level 

divergent zone of the Jet; weaker convection is found in the centre of the anomalies. At the same time at  

low levels there is strong convergence and advection of moist and humid air from Africa/Mediterranean

(Figure 1.17b), and from the Mexican Golf (Figure 1.17d), respectively that together with the upper-level 

cold advection and divergence forms the classical picture of strong synoptic forcing of  intense midlatitude 

convection. More on these cases can be found in the ECMWF Newsletter summer 2003. 

1.5 The diurnal cycle of convection 

Another important feature of the convection is a pronounced diurnal cycle in the tropics and the middle 

latitudes during the summer season. The diurnal cycle is primarily controlled by a change of vertical 

stability and moisture that arises as solar insolation heats the earth’s surface, and subsequently the 

atmosphere through diurnal variations in the surface fluxes, leading to the development of convection. 

Over land most observational studies, and also experimental studies using e.g. cloud resolving models, 

show that precipitation tends to occur in the afternoon or late evening. A typical diurnal evolution of 

surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and precipitation as a function of local solar time is depicted in 

Figure 1.18. Whereas the surface heat and moisture fluxes show a sinusodial curve peaking around local 

noon, the peak in surface precipitation occurs in the (late) afternoon. As discussed in e.g. Chaboureau et al. 

(2004) or Bechtold et al. (2014) the reasons for the roughly three hour delay between the surface flux and 

precipitation peaks might be explained as follows: shallow cumulus clouds already form in the early 

morning, followed by deeper still non-precipitating cumulus congestus around noon that transport 

moisture from the boundary-layer in the lower free troposphere. Once these clouds have sufficiently 

moistened the lower free troposphere, which in cases of a marked diurnal cycle is only weakly synoptically 

forced and therefore marginally stable, more and more and larger penetrating updraughts might develop. 

However, it will take further time of O(1000 s) until these updraughts grow to a precipitating stage, and 

further time until precipitation reaches the surface. Cold pool dynamics also play a role in the later stages 

of convective systems. 

The diurnal cycle can be globally assessed using either infrared satellite observations of the OLR (cold cloud 

tops) or retrievals from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar or 

microwave radiometer.  The phase and amplitude of the diurnal cycle can be evaluated from a 1-hourly

binned diurnal composite dataset by fitting a sine wave. Figure 1.19a shows the amplitude of the diurnal 

cycle (mm day-1) over the tropics. The amplitude, while being much stronger over land with values 

exceeding 10 mm day-1 the amplitude, is significant both over tropical ocean and land.  The phase is plotted 

in Figure 1.20. Over land, in particular the Amazonia, tropical Africa, India and Indonesia, radar derived 

rainfall rates (Figure 1.20a) indicate maximum rainfall that roughly occurs during late afternoon, early

evening though exhibiting important regional variability. In contrast, maximum rainfall rates over the 

tropical oceans occur during the late night and early morning hours (cloud radiative effects with infrared 

cooling of cloud tops and cloud base heating by surface fluxes), but again showing significant regional 

variations in particular close to major land masses (convective systems advected from inland), but probably 

also variations related to the main monsoon systems  (see also Yang and Slingo, 2001).

experimental forthcoming Cy39r1. Amplitude and phase are computed from the first harmonic of a 
Fourier decomposition (courtesy A. Beljaars for the diurnal cycle software). More model against 
observation comparisons on:   
http://www.ecmwf.int/products/forecasts/d/inspect/catalog/research/physics_clim/ 

 

Global models using convective parametrizations tend to reasonably represent the amplitude of the diurnal 

cycle, but have problems with the phase over land (Slingo et al. 1992; Bechtold et al. 2004; Clark, 2007) in 

that they typically produce maximum precipitation in phase with the surface fluxes (amplitude and phase) 

peaking around local noon. In contrast, cloud resolving models with horizontal resolutions of O(1 km) are 

able to correctly reproduce the phase of the diurnal cycle over land (Petch et al. 2002; Clark et al. 2007).

Figures 1.19b and 1.20b show that while the operational IFS in 2013 reasonably reproduces the amplitude 

of the diurnal cycle, it produces maximum precipitation over land that leads the observations by 4-5 hours. 

Is there a solution to this problem? A lot of trials have been made in the past on entrainment, prognostic 

formulations etc. And yes, as described in Bechtold et al. (2014)  and also Chapter 3.7 there is a simple and 

elegant solution as an extension to the current IFS convection scheme that allows for a largely improved 

representation of the diurnal cycle (Figures 1.19c and 1.20c).  

This formulation became operational in November 2014. Representing the dynamics of convective systems 

during night remains however a problem with convection parametrizations.

1.6 Buoyancy and the parcel or plume method 

So far a synoptic view of convection has been developed, and it is now time to present the basic tools that 

allow for a more quantitative description of convective processes and their feedback on the large-scale. 

1.6.1 Buoyancy 

Convective motions have been defined as buoyant 

motions in a stratified fluid. The force on a parcel 

immersed in a fluid under the action of gravity can be 

simply derived from Figure 1.21, where we assume that 

both the parcel and the fluid do not move. With 

A x y    the hydrostatic pressure force on the top 

surface of the cubic parcel is 2 1topF g h A  , and the 

pressure force at its bottom is 2 2botF g h A . The total 

force on the parcel is the sum of the pressure and gravity 

forces

As the first term of the rhs in (1.6) is equal to g it cancels with the third term; and if we neglect the last

where the first term of the rhs is an acceleration due to a non-hydrostatic pressure force, and the second

acceleration itself contains a contribution due to pressure and one due to temperature as follows from the 

ideal gas law

speed of sound) so that we can further simplify the vertical momentum equation to

Finally, in order to obtain the buoyancy acceleration in the case of moist air one has to replace the 

temperature by the virtual temperature (1 )v lT T q q   , with q  and lq  the specific humidities of water 

vapour and total condensate, respectively, and (1 ) / 0.608; /d vR R        with Rv = 461.525 J kg

To give an idea of the magnitude of the different terms in (1.11), a temperature perturbation of 1 K is 

equivalent to a moisture perturbation of 5 g kg-1 or a change in the condensate loading of 3 g kg-1. The 

approximate equilibrium in (1.10) between the non-hydrostatic pressure gradient acceleration and the 

buoyancy is illustrated in Figure 1.22. In short, a positively buoyant upward moving parcel experiences a 

non-hydrostatic pressure force that is directed downward, as its pressure perturbation is positive on its 

upper side and negative at its lower side.

(1.12) expresses CAPE in both height and pressure vertical coordinates is given (Rd is the gas constant of dry 

and not moist air as the moist effects are already accounted for in Tv). If one wants to estimate CAPE from a 

thermodynamic diagram T(p) as in Figure 1.23, the formulation in pressure coordinates is particularly 

useful. CAPE is then obtained as the area enclosed by the moist adiabat through cloud base which 

corresponds to the lifting condensation level (LCL), and the environmental temperature profile.  It is often 

observed that the level of free convection (LFC) lies above the LCL, as there is some area of stable 

stratification or convective inhibition (CIN) near cloud base. This stable layer near cloud base is an essential 

feature of moist convection as it allows CAPE to be stored above, without being immediately removed 

through mixing by convective draughts. Furthermore, as CAPE represents the potential energy a parcel, 

lifted to its LFC acquires during ascent to the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), i.e. the level where its virtual 

temperature becomes smaller than that of the environment (Figure 1.23), the corresponding kinetic energy 

or updraught velocity of the parcel can be estimated from the one-dimensional momentum equation as

perturbation constant, i.e. Tc =250 K, Tc – Te=5K, and z=10 km which gives w=60 m s-1. But this is a very high 

value that has been only observed in extreme events like Tornadic storms; updraught velocities are more 

likely to be in the range between 5 and 25 m s-1, so what is wrong ? This is investigated in the next 

subsection.

In Figure 1.24 are drawn profiles of θ, θe, and θes during an active convective period of the GARP Atlantic 

Tropical Experiment (GATE). An important characteristic of the tropical troposphere is that both θe, and θes 

are minimum in the mid-troposphere. The CAPE of the sounding in Figure 1.24 is obtained as the area 

between the constant θe line of an air parcel originating in the boundary-layer, conserving its θe, and the θes

where b
e  is constant and represents 

e at the parcels departure level; typically an average value over the 

lowest 100 or 500 m or 20 to 60 hPa of the boundary-layer is used. Note that (1.15) produces values that 

are roughly 25% larger than those obtained with (1.12). With the aid of Figure 1.24 one can easily recognize 

another important feature of oceanic convection in particular, i.e. there is no or only very small CAPE for 

parcels departing above the boundary-layer - in the present case parcels departing above 900 hPa have θe 

lower than 338 K which is lower than the minimum mid-tropospheric θes. 

In the definitions (1.14) and (1.15) of CAPE no mixing of the parcels with the environment has been taken 

into account, i.e. the ascent is supposed to be adiabatic (no mass and energy is exchanged with the 

environment). Also, the effect of water loading is included in (1.12) but not in (1.14)-(1.15), where it is 

assumed that all condensed water falls out as precipitation, i.e. the process is assumed to be pseudo-

adiabatic - a reasonable approximation. Overall, the processes of mixing and water loading will decrease 

the CAPE, whereas the inclusion of processes related to freezing of drops and sublimation (implicitly 

accounted for in the computation of Tc in (1.12), but not in (1.15) and also not accounted for in a 

Tephigram) generally produces slightly higher CAPE values . 

1.6.3 Mixing 

The most important process affecting the parcel properties is the mixing, or the exchange of mass between 

the air parcel and the environment. The mixing occurs through the engulfment of environmental air into 

the cloud as a result of turbulent motions, thereby increasing the mass of the cloud. As the environmental 

air is generally drier than the ascending plume, evaporation and evaporative cooling results from the 

mixing (entrainment) process, and then might further enhance the turbulent motions. The mixing of the 

cloud with the environment through turbulent flow is clearly visible in high-resolution numerical 

simulations of cumulus clouds (Figure 1.25a). Whereas the cloud base region in Figure 1.25a appears quasi 

flat, the two main ascending towers are strongly distorted by the flow. Note also that only the left 

updraught appears to be connected to ascending motion below cloud base, whereas the right updraught 

appears to be “disconnected” from the motions in the subcloud layer. 

In the past different idealised schemes have been utilized to account for the mixing process in simple one-

dimensional models representing a single or multiple cumulus updraughts. The principal mixing 

representations are illustrated in Figure 1.25b with from left to right: an undiluted ascent, a plume that is 

entraining all its way to the equilibrium temperature level or cloud top level, a plume that is only entraining 

at cloud top, and last multiple plumes where at each level mixing takes place leading to new updraughts. 

Recent numerical simulations, however, (e.g. Heus et al. 2008) suggest that actual mixing occurs laterally in 

form of turbulent mixing across the cloud edges (causing evaporation and sinking motion) and dynamically 

driven organized mixing (inflow) behind the “head” of the rising  plume as also evident from Figure 1.25a.

Finally, the effect of mixing on the pseudo-adiabat through cloud base and the CAPE is illustrated in Figure 

1.26. Mixing not only reduces the temperature difference between the cloud and the environment it can 

also reduce the maximum height to which a parcel can ascent or even suppress convection entirely if the 

environment is very dry (Zhang and Mc Farlane 1991). Therefore, via the effect of mixing and buoyancy 

moisture acts as a strong regulator on atmospheric convection (Tompkins 2001; Redelsperger et al. 2002).

1.7 Large-scale effects of convection 

1.7.1 Q1,Q2 and Q3 

Convection implies motions that are highly variable in space and time. It is therefore difficult to “measure” 

convection. However, one can measure, and also parameterize, the ensemble effect of the convective 

motions on the large-scale.  

Following Yanai et al. (1973) the ensemble or bulk effect of convection on the large-scale can be 

conveniently derived from the basic equations of motion in pressure coordinates using the dry static energy

ps c T gz  , and specific humidity q; recall that s is approximately conserved in dry adiabatic hydrostatic 

motions. The basic thermodynamic and dynamic equations write

meaning of (1.22) is that  i) column integrated heat can only be changed through radiation, surface sensible 

heat flux, and precipitation, ii) column integrated water vapour can only change through removal by 

surface precipitation and input by surface moisture flux, iii) total momentum is only changed through 

surface friction (an external force), therefore convective transport conserves momentum (not kinetic 

energy !). Furthermore, the constraints (1.22) must be fulfilled by the large-scale measurements to be 

consistent. Therefore they are also used as strong constraints in variational data assimilation procedures to 

derive consistent values of Q1-QR, Q2, Q3 from large-scale measurement campaigns. 

A final word on “convective forcing” in relation to the apparent heat sources is necessary. Generally, it is 

understood that the “large-scale forcing of convection” only comprises the large-scale advective 

tendencies, i.e. the last two terms of the rhs of (1.18), and not the Eulerian time derivative of the quantity

Deep convection 

Average profiles of Q1, Q2 QR as obtained during GATE phase III are shown in Figure 1.27. These profiles vary 

strongly as a function of convective activity. However, the characteristic features of these profiles for deep 

convective periods in tropical regions are the quasi parabolic shape of Q1 with a maximum in the middle 

tropical troposphere around 500 hPa, and a maximum of Q2 that occurs at lower altitudes around 700-850 

hPa. The latter is simply due to the fact that the water vapour content of the troposphere decreases with 

height so that most condensate is produced in the layers near cloud base. Similar profiles to Figure 1.27 

have also been obtained over the tropical West Pacific. Average profiles over the whole tropical belt can be 

estimated from Figure 1.3 by simply adding the contributions due to convection, turbulent diffusion and 

“stratiform” clouds.  

 

Figure 1.27: Average profiles of Q1, Q2 and QR  from GATE phase III. 

Shallow convection 

Apparent heat and moisture source profiles for shallow convection in the trade wind region have been 

derived e.g. by Nitta and Esbensen (1974) for the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment 

(BOMEX). These are depicted in Figure 1.28 together with modelling results obtained with the IFS. The two 

plots qualitatively agree in that there is a strong negative peak in Q2 corresponding to a moistening of the 

upper part of the cloud layer due to moisture transport and evaporation of cloud water. The evaporation of 

cloud water also leads to the negative peak of Q1 in the upper part of the cloud layer, whereas in the sub-

cloud layer there is heating due to surface fluxes. The two plots mainly differ in the sub-cloud layer for Q2, 

where one expects moistening due to surface fluxes and drying due to upward turbulent moisture 

transport - the results in Figure 1.28 for this region should therefore be regarded as uncertain.

Condensation and transport 

Following (1.19) convection affects the large-scale environment through condensational (evaporation) 

heating (cooling), and transport. The contribution of each process can be readily evaluated with the aid of 

CRM simulations, e.g. the condensational heating/cooling rates are obtained as the domain average 

microphysical tendencies of the model, and the transport terms are derived as divergence of the “eddy” or 

“convective” fluxes computed as

computed the contribution of the transport and condensational heat to the Q1 and Q2 budget, respectively 

for a squall line case (Figure 1.29). The important information from Figure 1.29 is that the Q1 budget is 

dominated by the condensational heating, meaning that convective draughts are driven by condensational 

heating, whereas the transport term is small for temperature. However, the contributions for transport and 

condensation are equally important  and of opposite sign in the Q2 budget, implying a lower (mid- and 

upper) tropospheric drying (moistening) through water vapour transport, and apart from low-level rain 

evaporation, a general drying of the troposphere through rain out. 

1.7.2 Mesoscale convective systems 

Regions with active convective draughts that is draughts that are buoyant and in the case of updraughts are 

saturated, cover only very small fractional areas of O(1-5%). However, convection is often organized in 

larger clusters or systems, so called mesoscale convective systems, that consist of an active convective 

region of O(1-10 km), or in the case of squall lines a  narrow convective band, and a large trailing stratiform 

region of O(10-500 km). Such a system, consisting of a leading convective part with strong 

updraught/downdraught  motion, and a mesoscale ascent (descent) in the upper  (lower) half of the trailing 

stratiform region, is schematically illustrated in  Figure 1.30 (see also  Figure 1.17 for satellite images). 

 

Figure 1.30: Schematic of a mesoscale convective system (squall line) moving to the right, with 
convective and stratiform precipitating areas. (After Houze 1993). 

Both, the convective and stratiform region contribute significantly to the dynamics and the precipitation 

produced by the system. Large-scale measurements of Q1-Q3 do not allow distinguishing between the 

convective and stratiform contributions to the apparent sources, and strictly speaking such a distinction is 

not possible as there is no clear scale separation in nature between the convective and large scales. 

However, common practice among observers and forecaster is to estimate (define) stratiform and 

convective contributions to the precipitation based on distinct radar reflectivities or rain rates (e.g. Steiner 

et al. 1995), with convective areas are typically defined as areas with surface precipitation rates  > 10 mm 

hr-1.  The Cloud Resolving Model (CRM) community (see e.g. Xu et al. 2002) often uses conditional sampling 

to estimate convective and stratiform contributions to Q1-Q3: either define convective model columns as 

columns with rain rates or alternatively, as columns that contain liquid water or ice and have updraught 

velocities > 1 m s-1 or downdraught velocities <-0.5 m s-1; the remaining cloudy columns are then being 

defined as stratiform. With the aid of a CRM the convective and stratiform contributions to the heat budget 

of the mesoscale convective system or the domain averaged heat budget in general, can be simply

As an example, an estimation of a characteristic “convective” and “mesoscale=stratiform” partition of Q1 

during GATE phase III is provided in Figure 1.31a as produced by Yanai and Johnson (1997). The main point 

is that the actual parabolic shape heating profile with maximum heating around 500 hPa, consists of a 

convective contribution with a strong peak further down, at around 600-700 hPa, and a mesoscale 

heating/cooling couple with upper-level heating due to the condensation in the elevated mesoscale ascent, 

and low-level cooling driven by the evaporation of  stratiform rain. 

For the sake of wider interest in spectral methods, an alternative method using Empirical Orthogonal 

Functions (EOFs) (see e.g. Toumazou and Cretaux (2001) for a description of the numerical method) has 

been used to decompose CRM data of convective situations (see also Lin and Arakawa 2000). As an 

example in Figure 1.31b is depicted a decomposition of Q2 into the first 4 leading EOFs2, each explaining a 

different degree of variance - the CRM data represents a time series of three-dimensional snapshots of 

convection during the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response

Experiment (TOGA-COARE). Obviously, the shape of these profiles is determined by the orthogonality 

constraint; however the first two leading EOFs could be interpreted as some mean and stratiform 

contributions, respectively. 

1.7.3 Quasi-equilibrium 

So far the last notion we need to introduce is “Quasi-equilibrium” which is one of the fundamental 

concepts that together with the CAPE is used in convective parameterizations. This concept, as first 

advocated by Arakawa and Schubert (1974), basically states that the convective activity (stabilization) is in 

quasi-equilibrium with the large-scale forcing (destabilization) of the atmosphere, so that the resulting rate 

of change in CAPE is small (see also Brown and Bretherton 1997). Therefore, this notion provides a 

simplified but tractable description of the convective activity or the overall interaction between the 

convection and the large-scale environment. An illustration of convective quasi-equilibrium is provided in 

Figure 1.32 showing a 20-day time series of Q1 and ω as observed during GATE phase III. Obviously, Q1 and 

ω are strongly correlated with positive/negative peaks in Q1 corresponding to heating/cooling, and 

negative/positive peaks in ω corresponding to large-scale ascent with cooling, and large-scale subsidence 

warming, respectively. Furthermore, the main peaks of either Q1 or ω in with periods of 2-4 days are 

actually associated to the passage of African easterly waves (see Section 1.3.4).

1.8 Summary 

• Convection is of crucial importance for the global energy and water balance 

• Convection generates and/or influences a number of phenomena important to forecasting 

(thunderstorms, heavy precipitation, hurricanes, shallow convection and boundary-layer 

properties) 

• On large horizontal scales convection is in quasi-equilibrium with the large-scale forcing 

(midlatitude synoptic disturbances, tropical waves) 

• An important parameter for the strength of convection is CAPE 

• Convection affects the atmosphere through condensation / evaporation and eddy transports 

• Shallow convection is present over very large (oceanic) areas, it is controlled by the surface fluxes 

but also controls the surface fluxes as a results of heat and mass transport out of the subcloud

layer. In the trades takes place the transport of vapor and momentum from the subtropics to the 

ITCZ. 

• Q1, Q2 and Q3 are quantities that reflect the time and space average effect of convective transport 

and precipitation (“unresolved scale”) and stratiform heating/drying (“resolved scale”). 

2 Parametrization of Convection 

Roughly 40 years have now passed since the pioneering work by Manabe and Stricker (1964), Kuo (1965), 

and Ooyama (1971) who first recognized the need to include some kind of convective parameterization in 

numerical models in order to represent “subgrid” convective activity, and to avoid grid-scale saturated 

ascents that could quickly lead to numerical instability (see also Arakawa (2004) for a review on “past 

present and future of cumulus parameterization”). 

 At that time the horizontal grid resolution of global models was something of O(400 km). Nowadays the 

horizontal resolution of global Numerical Weather Prediction models (NWPs) is of O(40 km) - in the IFS it is 

25 km since February 2005 - and will reach resolutions of 10 km in the coming decade. Furthermore, 

current and next generation limited area versions of NWPs will use horizontal resolutions of O(1-3 km), and 

therefore can resolve at least deep convection with reasonable accuracy. But there is also the venue of the 

multi-scale modelling approach for climate models (Randall et al. 2003), where a CRM is nested in each grid 

column of the global host model in order to represent explicitly deep convection and the cloud radiation 

interaction, and then feedback the corresponding subgrid tendencies to the host model, acting as some 

kind of “super” parameterization scheme. 

The reader might wonder if it is still up to date or necessary to learn about and to use “traditional” 

convective parameterization. Our answer is Yes, first of all, it is and will be in the next decade still too costly 

to run medium range (global) weather prediction and assimilation systems at resolutions that allow for an 

explicit representation for deep convection. Second, even CRMs still require parameterization schemes for 

shallow convection as shallow convective clouds have typical radius of O(100 m). Third, it is not yet clearly 

proven that higher horizontal resolution and explicit representation of convection produces better medium 

range forecasts than current forecasts using classical convection parameterizations, as higher resolution 

means more small-scale “noise” and uncertainty in the forecasts (in this case ensemble forecasts with an 

increased number of ensemble members would be necessary, further increasing the numerical burden). 

Classical convection parameterizations do generally efficiently stabilize the atmosphere and damp 

numerical noise. And last, but not least, classical convective parameterization schemes allow to 

“understand” or “constrain” convection in some easy manner; learning about these concepts and schemes 

is instructive and constitutes a good exercise.

2.1 Aims of convective parametrization 

The task a convection parameterization scheme has to fulfil is to calculate the collective effects of an 

ensemble of convective clouds in a model column as a function of grid-scale variables. Recall that these are 

represented by the Q1-QR, Q2, Q3.  

In practice convection parameterization includes three steps:  

i. Determine the occurrence and localisation of convection - this is often named as “Trigger of 

convection”  

ii. Determine the vertical distribution of heating, moistening and momentum changes - this task is 

generally done with the aid of a cloud model 

iii. Determine the overall amount of convective precipitation = energy conversion - this is the final step 

in a convection parameterization and is called “Closure”. 

However, as a convection parameterization is supposed to be globally applicable, requirements on the 

scheme include: remove convective instability and produce subgrid-scale convective precipitation 

(heating/drying) in unsaturated model grids, maintain a realistic vertical thermodynamic and wind 

structure, produce a realistic mean tropical climate, maintain a realistic variability on a wide range of time-

scales, produce a realistic response to changes in boundary conditions (e.g. sea surface temperature, 

orography), be applicable to a wide range of scales (typical 10 – 200 km) and types of convection (deep 

tropical, shallow, midlatitude and front/post-frontal convection), and finally, be simple and efficient for 

different model forecast configurations (high-resolution deterministic forecast, 4D-Var assimilation mode, 

Ensemble Forecast System, and monthly and seasonal forecast systems).  

2.2 Types of convection schemes 

Available parameterization schemes can be regrouped in three classes (the reference list is far from 

exhaustive and should only be taken as indicative) 

• Schemes based on moisture budgets 

o Kuo (1965, 1974) 

• Adjustment schemes 

o moist convective adjustement: Manabe (1965) 

o penetrative adjustment scheme: Betts and Miller (1986), Betts-Miller-Janic 

• Mass flux schemes (bulk+spectral) 

o multiple plumes , spectral model: Arakawa and Schubert (1974), Fraedrich (1976), Moorthi 

and Suarez (1992), Neggers et al. (2002), Cheinet (2004), Chikira and Sugiyama (2010), Park 

(2014) 

o single entraining/detraining plume - bulk model: e.g. Bougeault (1985), Tiedtke (1989), 

Gregory and Rowntree (1990), Kain and Fritsch (1990), Donner (1993), Bechtold et al (2001, 

2008, 2014), Piriou et al. (2007), Gerard (2015). 

o episodic mixing- Emanuel (1991)

Currently, most NWPs and climate models use mass flux schemes, but a variant of the Betts and Miller 

(1986) scheme is still used at the National Centre of Environmental prediction (NCEP). In the following, each 

class of schemes will be discussed, with particular emphasis on the mass flux approach. 

2.3 The “Kuo” scheme 

The basic assumption of the “Kuo” scheme is that convective activity that is the convective precipitation is 

linked to large-scale moisture convergence

where Pr denotes the surface precipitation flux, and b is the “Kuo” parameter which determines the part of 

the integrated moisture convergence that is converted into convective precipitation. The only remaining 

issue is then to determine the vertical distribution of the heating and moistening, which is done by 

assuming that the environment adjusts to a moist adiabat through cloud base. The “Kuo” scheme has often 

been criticized for its fundamental assumption that convection consumes water, instead of consuming 

potential energy, and therefore can lead to a positive feedback loop, where more convection mean more 

moisture convergence, and so on. However, it proofed useful and was one of the first convection schemes 

available.  

2.4 Adjustment schemes: the Betts-Miller scheme 

Representative for the class of adjustment schemes the Betts and Miller (1986) scheme is discussed here. 

The scheme says that if the atmosphere is unstable to a parcel lifted from the boundary-layer, and if there 

is a deep moist layer (for deep convection), adjust the atmospheric state back to a reference profile over 

some time scale. The convective tendencies for T and q produced by the scheme are then simply given by 

 ; ,

 (2.2) 

where τ is a convective adjustment time scale which is typically set to 1 hour for deep convection and 3 

hours for shallow convection. The reference profile for temperature Tref is constructed as the moist adiabat 

through cloud base, including the effects of ice phase changes. Unfortunately, there is no universal 

reference profile for humidity. However, the scheme is efficient and produces convective tendencies that 

are very smooth in space and time.  

Briefly, the procedure followed by the scheme can be described as follows. Find the most unstable layer in 

the lowest 200 hPa, draw a moist adiabat for this air and construct a first guess profile for T and compute a 

first-guess dewpoint adjustment profile q (Figure 2.1 a) - for a precise description how these reference 

profiles are constructed the reader is referred to the references and is also invited to consult the numerical 

code. Once this is done one has to check for conservation of enthalpy, i.e. the total adiabatic enthalpy 

change resulting from the adjustment of T must correspond to an equivalent change in the adjusted q

In the example in Figure 2.1  enthalpy is not conserved, and therefore the reference profiles must be 

shifted to the left as to conserve enthalpy.  This is the final step of the procedure and is illustrated in Figure 

2.2

in (b), and demonstrate in fact a non-conservation of enthalpy. (After J. Kain, private communication)

2.5 The mass flux approach 

The mass flux approach is a general and quite powerful method to tackle (eddy) transport problems in fluid 

mechanics, in particular for convective overturning where most of the transport is done by the “large” eddy 

draughts that carry heat and mass upward and downward over relatively large distances.

and its validity is discussed in e.g. Siebesma and Cuijpers (1995), and  Wang and Stevens (2000). Then, using 

(2.6) and (2.8)-(2.10), and after some straightforward manipulations (left for your exercise), the eddy flux is

This is known as the mass flux formulation, or the mass flux approximation taking into account that we

is the product of a convective scale velocity and an area fraction, and that in parameterizations schemes 

(not in CRM of course) it is generally only possible to determine the mass flux with reasonable accuracy, but 

not the individual components composing it. 

For readers still interested, we wish to mention an alternative way to derive the final mass flux equations

 (2.17) 

To predict the influence of convection on the large-scale with this approach we now need to describe the 

convective mass-flux, the values of the thermodynamic (and momentum) variables inside the convective 

elements and the condensation/evaporation term. This requires, as usual, a cloud model and a closure to 

determine the absolute (scaled) value of the mass flux. 

2.5.3 Mass flux entraining detraining plume model 

In order to determine the unknown quantities in (2.17), i.e. the mass flux, the in-cloud values, and the 

condensation rate, one applies the mass flux formalism again, but now for each individual cloud i. The cloud 

scale mass flux equations for mass continuity, enthalpy, and specific humidity then write

 (2.18) 

where it is assumed that the cloud exchanges mass with the environment through detrainment D of cloud 

mass and entrainment E of environmental air. The entrainment/detrainment rates E, D [s-1] are related to 

the classical fractional entrainment/detrainment per unit length [m--1] by E=M/ρ ε, and  D=M/ρ δ. The cloud 

environment mass exchange is depicted in Figure 2.4.

Actually, equations (2.18) already constitute a simplified one-dimensional set in the vertical coordinate p 

only. They are derived from a more complete three-dimensional set of cloud-scale equations where 

through integrations over variable cloud boundaries, the entrainment and detrainment coefficients appear 

as flux divergences in the horizontal directions4 - for a detailed derivation of (2.18) the interested reader is 

referred to Gregory and Miller (1989), and Siebesma (1998).  

Equation set (2.18) is still rather complicated and in general the following simplifications are applied

Entrainment 

The mass flux method is a quite powerful and simple method, however, its weak point is the need to 

specify the entrainment/detrainment rates. Unfortunately, in spite of many attempts (e.g. Siebesma and 

Cuijpers, 1995; Lin and Arakawa, 1997, Carpenter et al. 1998) there has been so far no universally valid 

formulation of entrainment rates applicable to all convective situations and in all schemes. - a detailed 

description of the entrainment/detrainment rates as used in the IFS is given in Chapter 3. 

As an alternative to the entraining plume model, the episodic mixing as proposed by Raymond and Blyth 

(1992) and Emmanuel (1991) is also briefly summarized. The method stems from observations that show 

that the entraining plume model might be a poor representation of individual cumulus clouds. The 

conceptual idea is that mixing is episodic, and that different parts of an updraught mix differently. The basic 

implementation of such a scheme might be summarized as follows: assume a stochastic distribution of 

mixing fractions for part of the updraught air, create N mixtures.  

Version 1: find level of neutral buoyancy of each mixture. 

Version 2: move mixture to next level above or below and mix again - repeat until level of neutral buoyancy 

is reached 

Unfortunately, although physically appealing the model is very complex, and numerical very expensive (its 

cost is proportional to the square of the number of vertical model levels.

 (2.19) 

The set of equations (2.19) is closed provided that the entrainment/detrainment rates are specified, and a 

microphysical scheme is available to determine the condensation/evaporation term. The equation for 1cQ

constitutes the “flux form” equation. An equivalent expression for 1cQ is obtained if one replaces the flux 

divergence term in 1cQ by the corresponding derivatives as given by the 2

obtain

 (2.20) 

This form is much simpler as it essentially only contains a mass flux advection term and a detrainment term, 

and therefore it is called the “advective” form. Note that the first equation of  (2.19)  and (2.20) are 

physically identical, but as we will see in Chapter 3 their numerical solution might in general differ slightly.  

The physical interpretation of  (2.20) is that convection affects the large scale environment by  

• Heating through compensating subsidence between cumulus elements (term 1) - this was already 

recognized by Bjerknes (1938) 

• The detrainment of cloud air into the environment (term 2) 

• Evaporation of cloud and precipitation (term 3) 

To avoid confusion, it is important to note that in the advective form (2.20) of the mass flux formulation, 

the condensation heating does not appear directly in Q1c. It is however a crucial part of the cloud model, 

where this heat is transformed in kinetic energy of the convective draughts. So there is no contradiction 

with the discussion in Subsection  0. 

2.5.5 Convective closure 

The cloud model determines the vertical structure of convective heating and moistening (microphysics, 

variation of mass flux with height, entrainment/detrainment assumptions). The determination of the 

overall magnitude of the heating (i.e., surface precipitation in deep convection) requires the determination 

of the mass flux at cloud base. This is called the closure problem.  

Deep convective closure: CAPE 

Prominent closure types for deep convection assume an equilibrium that establishes over a typical time 

scale of one hour between the production of CAPE (or cloud work function) by the large-scale, and its 



Atmospheric Moist Convection  
 

 

 

Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 45 

 

consumption by the convection. The production of CAPE by the large-scale forcing, and surface processes, 

as well as its consumption are schematically illustrated in Figure 2.5. 

  

Figure 2.5: Tephigrams illustrating (a) production of CAPE through large-scale processes (blue line), and 
convective stabilization, and (b) production of CAPE through surface fluxes, and downdraught effects, 
i.e. stabilization through cooling and increase of surface fluxes .The black solid lines denote the 
environmental temperature profile 

Shallow convective closures 

As for deep convection some schemes also use some kind of CAPE adjustment for shallow convection (e.g. 

Betts and Miller (1986), Bechtold et al. (2001)), but with a longer adjustment time-scale of typically three 

hours. 

Grant (2001) developed a simple equilibrium closure, where the cloud base convective mass flux is 

proportional to the product of the updraught fraction a and a convective scale velocity w*, the latter being 

proportional to the boundary-layer or cloud base height zPBL and the buoyancy flux HB

with the convective fraction a=0.03. 

The IFS model applies a boundary-layer equilibrium closure for shallow convection, and a CAPE closure for 

deep convection, both are in detail explained in Chapter 3. 

2.6 Summary 

• Convection parametrizations need to provide a physically realistic forcing/response on the resolved 

model scales and need to be practical. 

• A number of approaches to convection parametrization exist. 

• Basic ingredients to present convection parametrizations are a method to trigger convection, a 

cloud model, and a closure assumption. 



 
Atmospheric Moist Convection 

 

 

 

46 Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 

 

• The mass-flux approach has been successfully applied to both interpretation of data and 

convection parametrization. 

• The mass-flux approach can also be used for the parametrization of shallow convection.  

• It can also be directly applied to compute the transport of chemical species 

• The parametrized effects of convection on humidity and clouds strongly depend on the 

assumptions about microphysics and mixing in the cloud model --> uncertain and active research 

area 

• For the future, alternative approaches are already available based on an explicit representation of 

deep convection (Multi-model approach), on wavelets (Yano et al. 2005), general spectral methods 

(Fournier et al. 2003), or Neural Networks (Hsieh and Tang, 1998) 

3 The IFS convection parameterization 

The IFS convection scheme has been originally developed by Tiedtke (1989), and in the following has been 

continuously further developed and improved by Gregory et al. (2000), Jakob and Siebesma (2003), and 

Bechtold et al. (2004).5 

The general functioning of the scheme and the cloud (populations) it is supposed to represent are 

illustrated in Figure 3.1

ascending plume, and downdraught region. Further represented  features are trigger of convection,

The main characteristics of the scheme can be summarized as follows

In contrast to the cloud environment decomposition used in the derivation of the mass flux formulation in 

Chapter 2, the basic equations of the IFS scheme use a more complete convective updraught-downdraught-

static energy s, specific humidity q, the horizontal wind, cloud condensate, and passive chemical tracer

These equations are solved at the end of the convection code, after having evaluated the mass fluxes, the 

values in the up- and downdraughts and the precipitation production/evaporation. 

3.2 Triggering of convection 

The first step in the convection algorithm consists in the selection of convective columns. The procedure as 

illustrated in Figure 3.2 as follows:  

First test for shallow convection: add a T and q perturbation depending on the magnitude of the surface 

fluxes to a near surface air parcel. Do ascent with strong entrainment, check for LCL, solve uw equation (see 

next Section), continue ascent until the CTL is reached, which is defined as uw <0. If uw (LCL)>0 and p(CTL)-

p(LCL)<200 hPa , shallow convection is supposed to occur. 

Now test for deep convection with a similar procedure. Start close to the surface, form a 30 hPa mixed-

layer, add a temperature and humidity perturbation of 0.2 K and 41 10  kg kg-1, respectively, lift it to the 

LCL, do cloud ascent (i.e. condensate must be present) with small entrainment + water fallout until uw >0. 

The cloud is identified as deep convective if p(LCL)-p(CTL)>200 hPa. If the required cloud thickness is not 

attained, test subsequent mixed-layers, lift them to the LCL, test for cloud thickness etc., until a sufficiently 

deep cloud is found. However, for economic and physical reasons the procedure is only repeated for 

departure layers inside the lowest 300 hPa of the atmosphere.  

If neither shallow nor deep convection is found, a third type of convection – “midlevel” – is activated, 

originating from any model level above 500 m, if large-scale ascent prevails and the relative humidity at 

that level exceeds 80%. 

 

Figure 3.2: Illustration of Trigger procedure on a Skew-T diagram, including environmental profiles of  
temperature and dewpoint temperature (black), a near surface layer used as departure level for shallow 
ascent (pink), and a 30 hPa deep source layer (dark green) used for a first guess deep ascent (sky blue). If 
no deep ascent is found, the procedure is repeated for departure layers in the lowest 300 hPa. Note also 
that the cloud top level (CTL) might lie above the equilibrium temperature level (ETL), as it is determined 
by the level where the parcel vertical velocity vanishes, and the parcel might overshoot its ETL.

is actually not included in the model, but modelled through higher 

entrainment and detrainment coefficients for momentum. With this parameterization the model is only 

able to produce downgradient=“diffusive” momentum transport, reducing the vertical wind shear (as 

observed in unorganized “popcorn” convection), but not upgradient transport, leading to an increase in 

vertical wind-shear (this processes might be important in organized convective systems). Much effort has 

been made in analysing and parametrizing the difficult cloud-scale pressure gradient term (Zhang and Cho, 

1991; Kershaw and Gregory 1997; Zhang and Wu 2003). The most “handy” parameterization available is 

probably that of Gregory et al. (1997), where the cloud scale pressure gradient term is expressed as

where ϒ=0.5 is the virtual mass coefficient, and cd  =0.506 is a drag coefficient (Simpson and Wiggert, 1969), 

β =1.875, and ft = 2 is introduced because the flow is highly turbulent (Cheng et al. 1980). 

These equations are solved (model) level by level, starting at the LCL. 

3.4 Cloud model equations: downdraughts 

The downdraught plume is represented as an updraught plume taken upside down. The downdraught 

equations are solved starting at the estimated downdraught top, which actually is the level of free sink 

(LFS), defined as the level where a mixture of updraught and environmental air becomes negatively 

buoyant through evaporation of cloud condensate and melting of precipitation. As a rule of thumb, the 

level of free sink corresponds to the level of minimum 
e  which is generally around the zero degree 

isotherm. Initializing the downdraught mass flux at the LFS proportional to the updraught mass flux at cloud

3.5 Entrainment and detrainment 

Entrainment is the single most important parameter in a mass flux convection parametrization. The 

entrainment and detrainment rates are expressed as a sum of “mixing” (1) and “organized” (2) 

contributions

A similar expression is used for the downdraught detrainment/entrainment rates. The mixing contributions 

stem from a formulation by Simpson (1983) that expresses the fractional entrainment rate as being 

inversely proportional to the cloud radius,

imply an assumed ensemble mean updraught radius at cloud base of roughly 100 m for deep convection, 

and 50 m for shallow convection implying a pretty strong entrainment. Entrainment is applied to positive 

buoyant convective clouds only. In (3.19) we have also included a vertical scaling function scalef  in order to 

mimic the effect of a cloud ensemble. As the scaling function strongly decreases with height, the mixing 

detrainment will eventually become larger than the entrainment, and the mass flux starts to decrease with 

height. The entrainment rate is further modulated by the relative humidity of the environment, so that the 

final entrainment formulation writes

This turns out to be probably the simplest formulation to allow for high entrainment rates near cloud base 

and to account for the observation that (mid) tropospheric relative humidity controls the cloud top heights, 

and plays an important role in the modulation of tropical waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (Lin et 

al. 2008, Kim et al. 2011).  Typical entrainment profiles produced by  (3.21) for an atmosphere under 

constant forcing but with different values of free-tropospheric humidity are shown in Figure 3.3. The 

entrainment profiles closely correspond to the LES results by Derbyshire et al. (2011) (their Figure 5) and 

also show a clear transition with increasing mid-tropospheric humidity from shallow convection, with tops 

near 2 km, to deep convection. The reader is referred to the comprehensive overview on entrainment by 

De Rooy et al. (2012) where further typical shallow and deep convective entrainment and detrainment 

profiles are provided.

Organized detrainment is active when negative buoyancy occurs. It is then set proportional to the change in

3.7.1 Deep convection 

Following the derivation Bechtold et al. (2014) that included earlier work by Donner and Philips (2003), 

Nordeng (1994) and Gregory et al. (2000), an equilibrium is assumed between the large-scale and 

boundary-layer forcing (generating convective available potential energy) and convection (reducing the 

CAPE). As a measure of CAPE (J kg-1) we use the density-weighted buoyancy integral of an entraining 

ascending air parcel, denoted as PCAPE (J m-3)

The advantage of PCAPE over an entraining CAPE is the density scaling that more readily relates the time 

derivative of PCAPE to the convective mass flux.  Taking the time derivative of (3.27) one can derive a 

prognostic equation for PCAPE and identify the different production/sink terms: the production by large-

scale advection (LS), the production by boundary-layer processes (surface heat fluxes, BL) and  a sink of 

PCAPE  due to convective transport and mixing and evaporative cooling

Knowing all the different terms we can integrate (3.28) . Here we aim for a diagnostic equilibrium solution 

where /PCAPE t   is small compared to the rhs terms – this is also often referred to as convective quasi-
equilibrium (Arakawa and Schubert, 1974). The trick is to express the convective tendency so that this 

condition is fulfilled. We can either express the convective tendency by a relaxation term, assuming that 

convection reduces PCAPE over a time-scale τ toward a reference value PCAPEbl, or by assuming that 

convection counteracts the large-scale forcing by stabilization through environmental compensating 

subsidence – this latter expression then brings in the convective mass flux which is the required quantity in a 

mass flux convection scheme

We still need to specify the convective adjustment time τ. In previous IFS cycles this was a constant

adjustment (rainfall) and convection-large-scale interaction are obtained using a convective turnover 

timescale / ures c resH w     , where τc is the convective turnover time scale, H the cloud depth, 
uw  is the 

vertically averaged updraught velocity, and 
res is a factor depending on the horizontal model resolution. 

As the large-scale forcing = horizontal divergence varies linearly as a function of horizontal resolution, so 

does  res  from a value of 1 at dx=10 km to a maximum value of 2.6 at dx=125 km. 

The PCAPEbl term requires further elaboration. In model cycles prior to November 2013 this term has not 

been considered, implying that deep convection removes all PCAPE (Gregory et al. 2000). This assumption 

obviously fails in non-equilibrium situations with rapidly varying boundary-layer forcing such as the diurnal 

cycle of convection and the convection tied to advective boundary-layers. As shown in Shutts and Gray 

(1999) deep convection scales with the surface buoyancy flux and therefore for convection rooting in the 

boundary-layer (lowest 50 hPa) Bechtold et al. (2014) have expressed the departure from equilibrium by 

PCAPEbl but using the integrated tendencies instead of the surface flux

where   is the value at the arrival point (current model level k), and the value at the departure point 

(subscript dep) is the environmental value a distance uM g t  “back” from the current pressure level. In 

general the departure point lies between two model levels so that an interpolation is involved. In practice 

one solves (3.49) iteratively, evaluating the advection velocity first at the arrival point, and in the following 

iterations at the new departure points. The advantage of the semi-lagrangian method is that it is stable, the 

mass fluxes or time step are not subjected to the CFL stability criterion. There is, however also a stability 

criterion (“the iteration will not converge”) for (3.49) known as the Lifschitz criterion saying that

which is  less stringent than the CFL as it implies only the divergence of the mass flux, and not the mass flux 

itself. The drawback of the semi-lagrangian solution is that it is not formally conserving (evaluating the 

vertical integral of (3.49) will depend on discretization and accuracy of interpolation); this is why in the IFS 

the preferred solution is the implicit formulation in flux form described in Subsection 3.8.3. 

3.9 Tracer transport experiments 

Examining tracer transport in convective situations allows to visualise, understand and evaluate convective 

transport. We conclude this Chapter with numerical tracer transport experiments, comparing the tracer 

transport as simulated with the IFS convection scheme in single-column and fully three-dimensional global 

mode, against corresponding CRM simulations.

3.9.1 Numerical stability 

In the first experiment, single-column model (SCM) simulations forced with observed large-scale tendencies 

for temperature and humidity are performed for a period of continental convection observed during the 

ARM 1997 experiment over the Great Planes (Xu et al. 2002). The convective and total surface precipitation 

simulated by the model, as well as the observed precipitation are plotted in Figure 3.5. Three main 

precipitation events can be detected with the last one producing intensities of 80 mm h-1. Generally, the 

precipitation events are reasonably reproduced by the IFS SCM. 

 

Figure 3.5: Evolution of convective (a) and total rainfall rates (mm/day) (b) as simulated by the IFS SCM 
and observed during the ARM 1997 experiment. The SCM is forced with observed surface fluxes, and 
large-scale tendencies for temperature and humidity. 

 

 

Figure 3.6: Stability tests for a mid-tropospheric tracer using explicit and implicit time integrations at 
different CFL numbers (3.43). The different CFL numbers are generated by scaling the mass fluxes prior 
to their use in the tracer routine. 

In Figure 3.6 the evolution of a mid-tropospheric tracer with initial concentration one is examined using 

two different time integration schemes, an explicit scheme and an implicit scheme, at different CFL 

numbers. In order to keep the time evolution of the mass fluxes the same in each experiment, the different 



Atmospheric Moist Convection  
 

 

 

Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 59 

 

CFL numbers are not obtained by changing the time step of the model, but by scaling the convective mass 

fluxes prior to their use in the routine that computes the convective tracer transport. We observe that for 

CFL=0.8 the explicit and implicit solutions barely differ. However, for CFL=2 instabilities occur in the explicit 

solution after t=85 hours (in fact heavily positive and negative values appear that for problems with colour 

shading do not readily become apparent in Figure 3.6b), whereas the implicit solution is perfectly stable 

even for CFL=10 (Figure 3.6c). The results for CFL=10 from the explicit are omitted as they are off scale. 

More information can be drawn from Figure 3.6c-d, namely that for increasing mass flux, a mass flux 

scheme behaves like a diffusion scheme, where all concentrations become perfectly mixed. 

3.9.2 Comparison SCM, CRM and global simulations 

The IFS SCM simulations forced with large-scale tendencies for temperature and humidity observed during 

TOGA-COARE, are evaluated against CRM simulations (courtesy J.-P. Chaboureau using the Meso-nh model) 

that are forced in an identical manner. Tracers are initialized in the boundary-layer and mid-troposphere. 

Furthermore, global simulations are performed for the same period starting from the ERA-40 year 

reanalysis, and using horizontally uniform tracer fields in order to mimic the absence of horizontal 

advection in the SCM and CRM. 

Figure 3.7 shows the evolution of the convective and total rainfall rate as produced by the IFS SCM and the 

CRM. Reassuringly, the IFS convection scheme produces rainfall rates (and therefore also mass fluxes) that 

are close to the CRM results, so that the following comparison of convective tracer transport by the two 

models is supposed to be meaningful.   

 

Figure 3.7: Evolution of convective (top) and total (bottom) rainfall rate as produced by the IFS SCM and 
the CRM. 

The evolution of a boundary-layer tracer and a mid-tropospheric tracer as produced by the IFS convection 

parameterization and the CRM is shown in Figure 3.8. In both models, the boundary-layer tracer is rapidly 

transported to the tropopause in the convective draughts that have their roots inside the boundary-layer. 

In contrast, the mid-tropospheric tracer is moved upward, but also slowly downward due to the so called 

cumulus induced environmental subsidence. After a period of 3 days both the lower- and mid-tropospheric 

tracer becomes quasi well-mixed, even if the CRM shows somewhat less mixing the IFS SCM. The tracer 



 
Atmospheric Moist Convection 

 

 

 

60 Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 

 

evolution obtained from the IFS global model at resolution T159 is shown in Figure 3.9 as average over the 

TOGA-COARE region. The results reasonably correspond to that in Figure 3.8, but the tracers go up higher 

due to the higher tropopause in the global run (the tropopause in the SCM and CRM runs is actually too low 

due to non-accurate forcing data above 14 km).

For better comparison, the horizontal advection has been switched off for tracers. 

Finally, a useful tool to represent convective mixing/transport is the Mixing Matrix. The dimensions of the 

matrix are K x K, where K is the number of model levels, and initially its values are zero apart from the 

diagonal elements that have value unity. The Mixing Matrix is universal and can be applied to any passive 

tracer. It is also a useful tool to verify the numerics of the convection scheme as its row values should 

always sum to 1, and neither be negative nor exceed  1 (monotonicity), and the vertical integral over 

pressure of its column values must be constant in time (conservation). In Figure 3.9 it is illustrated for the 

present case for day 1 and 3 of the integration. Non-zero elements in the upper-left part of the matrix 

indicate rapid updraught transport, elements just below the diagonal slow subsiding motions, and elements 

far below the diagonal rapid downdraught transport. After about 3 days the matrix becomes “full”. If one 

wants to perform back-tracing experiments, i.e. to determine the original profile/source of a measured 



Atmospheric Moist Convection  
 

 

 

Meteorological Training Course Lecture Series 61 

 

tracer concentration one could invert the mixing matrix. However, after a few time steps this becomes 

impossible as the matrix becomes singular, indicating that de-mixing is unphysical. The transpose or adjoint 

of the matrix, however, always exists and is the preferred tool for back-tracing experiments. Further 

experimentation showed that the adjoint is useful (there is sufficient sensitivity or information) for periods 

on the order of 12-48h depending on the convective events.

4 Forecasting - case studies 

We wish to conclude the course with a few case studies on deep convective situations within their synoptic 

environment, and to illustrate the relevant available ECMWF products. 

4.1 1-4 December 2003 French flood 

The synoptic situation for 3 December 2003 12 UTC is displayed in Figure 4.1. As shown by a comparison 

between the analyses and the 48h deterministic forecast in Figure 4.1a,b, the synoptic situation with a 

large PV streamer (“trough”) extending over the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa, a strong low-level 

Jet between Tunisia/Sicily and south-eastern France bringing hot and humid air, is well forecasted by the

deterministic system 48h ahead. Furthermore, at the 250 hPa level (Figure 4.1c) strong upper-level 

divergence occurs over Tunisia/northern Algeria, and further northward over the Mediterranean. 

Associated with the flow, two V-shaped convective systems can be identified, one over northern Algeria, 

and a smaller but more intense system forming between the Baleares islands and Sardinia. CAPE is rather 

localized but attains values of up to 2000 J kg-1 in the latter system (Figure 4.1d), where low-level 

convergence of water vapour and warm air advection attains its maximum values. Weaker convection is 

present off the Portuguese coast in the “cold part” of the trough or PV anomaly. The synoptic analysis is 

also confirmed by lightning observations, showing weaker convection around the Iberian Peninsula, but 

strong lightning along a southeast-northwest oriented line between Algeria and south-eastern France. 

Similar cases have been discussed in (Bechtold and Bazile 2001; Stein et al. 2000)

Figure 4.2: Lightning observations for Europe between 00 and 17 UTC, 3 December 2003 (Courtesy 
http://www.wetterzentrale.de). 

Actually, the period with intense convective rains over south-eastern France lasted from 1 to 4 December 

2003. To get an idea of the predictability of these synoptically forced convective rain events, the area 

averaged observed precipitation together with the forecasted values, obtained from forecasts with 

different start (base) times, is depicted in Figure 4.3. The reassuring result is that as the event approaches, 

the forecasts become more accurate. Experience with the current IFS system indicates that for strongly 

forced convection, deterministic forecasts with lead times of 48-96h can still be considered as sufficiently 

accurate for warnings. More information on the predictability of such events can be obtained from the 

Ensemble Prediction System (EPS), consisting of 50 perturbed ensemble members. As an example, the 

probability, as obtained from the EPS, for the 72h accumulated precipitation to exceed 150 mm is depicted 

in Figure 4.4 for different forecast lead times. For the current situation, an indication of an extreme 

precipitation event is already indicated 5 days ahead. With decreasing lead time the probabilities increase 

and the location becomes more accurate (this is not necessarily always like this, but the presence of 

orography, determining the low-level flow, makes the convection more “predictable” in the present case.

4.2 Convective adjustment 

The next example illustrates the convective adjustment occurring in forced continental convection. The 

satellite picture from 4 July 2001 16 UTC (Figure 4.5), and the ECMWF analysis (Figure 4.6) from 12 UTC 

show a trough over the Golf of Biskaya generating advection of moist and warm air from the south-west 

and south-east. High low-level
e  values, combined with upper-level divergence, and strong large-scale 

lifting at 700 hPa, occur over the south-west of France, where convective clusters, actually bringing hail, can 

be identified on satellite image. The clusters exhibit the typical south-west north-east orientation that is 

characteristic for northern hemisphere middle latitude convection.

In order to illustrate the adjustment process, we consider the observed soundings at Bordeaux-Merignac in 

southwest France for 4 July 2001 at 00 and 12 UTC (Figure 4.7). The 00 UTC sounding, prior to the 

convective event, shows between 850 and 600 hPa a layer with hot south-westerly flow, also the 200 hPa 

westerly flow is pronounced. In contrast, in the 12 UTC sounding that has been taken during or just after 

the convective event, this warm unstable layer of air disappeared, the lower atmosphere has been cooled 

by evaporation of precipitation, and advection of colder air, whereas the upper-troposphere has been 

moistened through convective transport and large-scale ascent in the convective regions. The resulting 

stratification of the troposphere is close to moist adiabatic.

4.3 Partly orographically forced convection over Iberian Peninsula 

The last example treats a case with relatively weak synoptic forcing, where the role of surface fluxes and 

orography becomes more important. The ECMWF analysis for 2 July 2001 6 UTC (Figure 4.8) shows a 

distinct PV anomaly with a strong Jet at its western flank extending from Scandinavia, over eastern 

Germany, to Italy. The corresponding infrared Meteosat satellite Figure 4.9a image shows frontal clouds 

and convection over Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Greece, below and ahead of the PV anomaly. 

However, a weak PV anomaly is also present over the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula. As over 

this area also relatively high values of 
e  occur, it is a suspected favourable region for convection to occur. 

Indeed, the satellite image, and also the lightning observations confirm localized convection over this area, 

especially over the mountainous region (Figure 4.9). 

The closest radiosonde observation station available in this area is La Coruña at the Galician coast. The 

radiosonde data for 2 July 2001 11 UTC (Figure 4.10)  shows relatively cold air at low levels, below 900 hPa,  

a relatively dry, and dry-adiabatically stratified  layer between 900 and 700 hPa, topped by a more moist 

layer between 700 and 500 hPa.. The relatively cold and moist near surface air has certainly been advected 

from the nearby sea.  

Given the sounding, one expects convection only for air parcels departing above 900 hPa. Therefore, 

convection is more probable over nearby mountainous regions where the necessary parcel lifting is 

provided to overcome near cloud base convective inhibition. Furthermore, further inland strong surface 

sensible heat fluxes may sufficiently heat the lower atmospheric layers, thereby reducing the CIN, and 

increasing the air parcels CAPE. The observations in Figure 4.9 do support these explanations.

areas), 330 K PV (blue isolines), and 850 hPa e (coulour shaded).

4.4 Forecasted satellite imagery 

Since 2005 ECMWF also provides forecasted satellite images for the first 120h of the deterministic forecast. 

These “synthetic” satellite images are generated with the aid of a radiative transfer model  (RTTOVS = 

Radiative Transfer model for TOVS, ATOVS, and several other atmospheric sounders) that computes the 

radiation a satellite  would see in a certain spectral band, given the atmosphere forecasted by the model (p, 

T, q and cloud condensate). Forecasted satellite images are only available for the water vapour and infrared 

spectral bands as complications would arise for the visible band due to angle geometry and unknown 

surface emissivities. The synthetic satellite images also allow for a very useful evaluation of the forecast in 

terms of clouds, cloud top heights, and cloud optical thickness (actually brightness temperatures).  

As a first example is shown  in Figure 4.11 a comparison between Meteosat 9 observed and forecasted 

water vapour images (brightness temperatures in water vapour window channel)  from a short range 

forecast)of a record deep cyclone over the North-Eastern Atlantic on 8 October 2010. The example 

documents both the capability of the analysis and forecast system to represent the dry (black) and moist 

(grey/white) banding and filament structures in midlatitude cyclones. The model was even able to 

represent the cold frontal structure with embedded mesoscale convective systems off the Portuguese 

coast. 

 

Figure 4.11: Meteosat 9 water vapor channel (left), and corresponding forecasted satellite images by the 
IFS T1279 operational system for 8 October 2010 09 UTC. Forecast start date is 8 October 00 UTC. 

Finally, in Figure Figure 4.12 are provided in a full disk satellite view the  Meteosat 9 image (SEVIRI imager 

at 5 km horizontal resolution) corresponding to  the infrared window channel brightness temperatures for 

10 January 2014 15 UTC  and  the forecast satellite image from the IFS T1279 (16 km) high-resolution 

system with the forecast starting at 00 UTC.  

The model does a good job in representing the middle latitude synoptic systems as well as the oceanic 

trade-wind and stratocumulus area. As expected, tropical convection is more difficult as it is less ‘organized’ 

. However, the model is able to represent the gross features of the tropical rain systems including the land 

sea contrast and the diurnal cycle. One of the remaining weaknesses of the current forecast system is that 

summertime convection during evening/night dies out earlier than in observations.

5 Appendix: Simple wave types and quasi-geostrophic adjustment 

The discussion of simple linear wave types and motions that play a role in convection and the convective 

adjustment of the atmosphere closely follows Andrews et al (1987, Holton (2004, pp. 192 ff), Wheeler and 

Nguyen, and Verkley and van der Velde (2010). The discussion is far from being complete, and is only 

intended to provide some insight and the standard technical tools.

In addition to the previous case, we now consider larger-scale motions of the atmosphere, in particular 

midlatitude synoptic-scale systems where the momentum and mass distributions have been perturbed (e.g. 

through a strong convective heat/mass source), and the return to geostrophy is assured through excitation 

of waves. This problem has been first solved by G. Rossby (1930). Again for simplicity the shallow water 

equation system is considered, but this time on a rotating plane using a constant Coriolis parameter f0; the 

background basic state wind is set to zero, and the atmospheric scale height H=R T/g

The desired solution is a wave that decays away from the Equator. Solutions to this wave equation, which is

The equatorial Kelvin wave is a special solution for v=0. Its dispersion relation can be derived from (5.17) 

using v=0, but can be also recovered by setting n=-1. Its dispersion relation is simple that of a gravity wave

Therefore, Kelvin waves are non-dispersive waves with their phase speed c=ω/k equal to the group speed

and h, also note that as the shallow water system (5.17) is linear all linear combinations of the different 

solutions are also a solution to the system. In the simplest case of the Kelvin wave with v’=0 this becomes

For a set of solutions for all waves see Verkley and van der Velde (2010). Here we have also made use of 

the principle of separation of variables and introduced the final missing dependency, namely the 

propagation of vertical modes using the vertical structure function G(z)

Interestingly, this links the vertical wave number to the equivalent depth H of the wave.  

The different theoretical modes in the ω-k domain are illustrated in Figure 5.3 for the outgoing longwave 

radiation from the ECMWF operational analysis from 2008-2013 and an ensemble of 1-year integrations 

from 2001-2009 with Cy40r1 (2014). The figure is similar to Figure 1.13 but both the symmetric and anti-

symmetric  part are shown and a different method is employed to isolate the modes from their own 

background spectrum (wave analysis package courtesy Michael Hermann New Mexico Institute). 

Through a regression method one can also extract the vertical structure of the different modes. In 

particular for each variable all the time series at each latitude band and level are regressed to the point 

with maximum OLR variance (with OLR having been spectrally filtered for the specific mode and then 

transformed back to physical space). An example of the composite temperature, u-wind and specific 

humidity anomalies are shown in Figure 5.4 for the MJO mode (top row) and the Kelvin wave mode 

(bottom row). The MJO anomalies are significantly larger than the kelvin mode anomalies. However, both 

the MJO and Kelvin mode anomalies show the characteristic baroclinic westward tilt with height of the 

anomalies in the troposphere, the tilt in the anomalies is reverted in the stratosphere for the Kelvin mode – 

note that contrary to the Rossby waves that have westward phase and are absorbed in the upper 

troposphere by the prevailing easterly (westward) winds speed, the Kelvin waves with easterly phase speed 

can propagate through the stratosphere. 

Finally, note the large westerly wind anomaly behind the main MJO convection in the lower troposphere, 

and the significant lower tropospheric moist anomalies for both the MJO and the Kelvin waves ahead and 

during the convective phase.

spectrum.
