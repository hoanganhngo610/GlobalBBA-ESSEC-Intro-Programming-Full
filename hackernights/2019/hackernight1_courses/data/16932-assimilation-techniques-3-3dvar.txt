1. INTRODUCTION

This aim of this lecture is to complement the more theoretical presentation of 3dVar given in the “Assimilation al-

gorithms” module with a discussion of some of the techniques which are necessary for a practical implementation

of the method. The ECMWF implementation of 3dVar is described. This was the operational ECMWF analysis

between 30 January 1996 and 24 November 1997. The reader is referred to Andersson et al. 1998, Courtier et al.

1998 and Rabier et al. 1998 for a more detailed description.

The topics covered in this lecture are:

• The incremental method

• Initialization of analysis increments

• Formulation of the background cost function

• Methods for calculating background error statistics

2. THE INCREMENTAL METHOD

Ideally, the analysis cost function should be specified in terms of fields which have the same resolution as the fore-

cast model. However, this makes the cost function computationally expensive to minimize (especially in 4dVar,

where the much of the computational expense is in the tangent-linear and adjoint models.)

The incremental method reduces computational expense by minimizing a cost function which has a lower resolu-

tion than is used by the forecast model. This is reasonable because analysis increments are generally rather smooth,

at least with current methods for specifying background error correlations.

The incremental method is an iterative procedure. For each iteration , an approximate analysis is generated

from an initial approximation  by:

(1)

Here, denotes the pseudo-inverse of an operator which reduces the resolution of the model fields to the

resolution used for the cost function. (For example, might correspond to spectral truncation.) The pseudo-

inverse of is an operator which increases resolution (for example by padding the spectrum with zeros). In this

case,  increases the resolution of the increment  to match that of the analysis.

The increment, , is calculated by minimizing the cost function:

(2)

Note in particular that the observation operator acts on the high resolution fields whereas the operator

 acts on the low resolution increment.

The incremental method is described above as an iterative procedure. However, there is generally no guarantee that

the iterations will converge. For this reason, a typical implementation of the method performs only a few iterations.

2.1  Implementation of the Incremental method in the ECMWF 3dVar

In the case of the ECMWF 3dVar system, a single iteration of the incremental method is performed. The initial

approximation to the analysis, , is simply the background. The analysis consists of 3 steps:

2.1 (a)  Comparison with the observations at high resolution. This step calculates . The back-

ground fields are transformed to gridpoint space and then interpolated to observation locations. 12-point bi-cubic

interpolation is used for upper-air fields. Bi-linear interpolation is used for surface fields to avoid problems near

surface discontinuities (e.g. coastlines) and steep orography.

Observation operators are applied to the interpolated model fields to calculate the model equivalents of the obser-

vations. The observations are compared with their model equivalents and the differences between the two (i.e. the

departures) are written to the observation file, for use in the minimization. Obviously-bad observations are screened

out at this stage by removing observations with very large departures.

2.1 (b)  The minimization. This step calculates the low-resolution increment, . The high-resolution upper-

air background fields are truncated to T63. The gridpoint surface fields are transformed to spectral space, truncated

to T63, and transformed back to gridpoint space. This ensures consistency between the spectral and gridpoint fields

used in the minimization. In the case of the 31-level model, non-linear normal mode initialization (NNMI) is ap-

plied to the fields to adjust them to the low resolution orography. (NNMI has been found to give unsatisfactorary

results in the 50-level and 60-level versions of the model, so no initialization of the low-resolution background is

performed for these vertical resolutions.)

The low resolution cost function for the increments is minimized using a quasi-Newton method (Gilbert and Le-

maréchal, 1989). Variational quality control of observation departures is applied during the minimization (Anders-

son and Järvinen, 1998).

2.1 (c)  Updating at high resolution. This step calculates the high-resolution analysis, .

Since the low resolution analysis is balanced with respect to the low resolution orography, it is desirable to initialize

the analysis increment to adjust it to the high-resolution orography. However, NNMI is a non-linear procedure. It

must be applied to whole fields rather than to increments. For the 31-level model, the high resolution analysis is

defined as:

(3)

No initialization is performed for the 50-level and 60-level versions of the model.

3. THE BACKGROUND COST FUNCTION

The background error term of the cost function is crucial to the performance of the analysis system. A simple ex-

ample suffices to show why.

3.1  Example

Suppose we have a single observation of the value of a model field (e.g. temperature) at one gridpoint, correspond-

ing to the element of the state vector. The observation operator is very simple in this case, and is represented

by the  matrix whose  element is equal to one, and whose other elements are all zero:

(4)

The gradient of the cost function is zero at the minimum, and (in the non-incremental formulation) is given by:

(5)

Multiplying through by , and rearranging gives

(6)

But, for this example, is simply equal to the column of . Also, since we have just a single observation,

is simply the scalar value , where is the analysed gridpoint value

corresponding to the observation, and where  is the variance of observation error. Thus:

(7)

That is, the analysis increment is proportional to a column of the background error covariance matrix, . In other

words, the background covariance matrix controls how information is spread out from the single observation, to

provide statistically consistent increments at the neighbouring gridpoints and levels of the model, and to ensure

that observations of one model variable (e.g. temperature) produce dynamically consistent increments in the other

model variables (e.g. vorticity and divergence).

3.2  Formulation of the background cost function in the ECMWF 3dVar

The background error covariance matrix is enormous, typically . This is much too large to fit into com-

puter memory. Moreover, even if this was possible, we don’t have enough statistical information to determine all

its elements. We are forced to simplify things.

One way to approach the construction of the background error covariance matrix is to build a matrix for which

the variable has covariance matrix equal to the identity matrix. The background cost function may

then be written as

(8)

The background error covariance matrix is defined implicitly by  as .

The effect of multplying background error by the matrix is to remove the correlations between its elements. (Re-

member that the correlation matrix for is the identity matrix. That is, the elements of are uncorrelated.) A

natural way to build is as a sequence of steps, each of which removes some correlation from the background

error.

The most obvious correlation in the background errors is the balance between mass errors and wind errors in the

extra-tropics. We therefore define our as , where the matrix takes the model variables (vortic-

ity, divergence, temperature, log(surface pressure), specific humidity, and ozone mixing ratio) and subtracts from

the temperature and log(surface pressure) components which are in balance with the vorticity. A component is also

subtracted from the divergence to remove the correlation between divergence and vorticity due to Ekman pumping

near the surface, and compensating upper-tropospheric outflow. Similarly, a balanced component is subtracted

from the ozone to account for the correlation between vorticity and ozone background errors.

The balanced components of temperature, log(surface pressure), divergence and ozone are defined as:

(9)

where the matrix has the same form as the linear balance operator relating vorticity to height, but has

coefficients which are statistically determined. The matrices , and account for the vertical correlation

between “height” (as defined by ) and the balanced temperature, log(surface pressure), divergence and ozone.

These matrices are block diagonal, with one full vertical matrix for each spectral component, whose coefficients

depend only on the total wavenumber .

The balance operator, , is intended to remove all correlations between different variables. The remaining part

of the change of variable, , is therefore block diagonal, with one block for each of the variables (vorticity, tem-

perature-and-log(surface pressure), divergence, and ozone). Each block has the same form, for example the block

corresponding to vorticity is:

(10)

Here, divides the vorticity by its standard deviation of background error; removes horizontal

correlation; and  removes vertical correlation.

Division by background error standard deviation is performed in gridpoint space, to allow a spatial variation of

background error. However, the horizontal correlations are assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic.

This makes  diagonal, with coefficients which depend only on the total wavenumber .

The matrix is block diagonal, with one vertical matrix for each spectral component, whose coefficients de-

pend only on the total wavenumber. This structure allows the vertical correlations to vary with horiziontal scale, so

that large horizontal scales have deeper vertical correlations than small horizontal scales. It does not allow spatial

variation of the vertical correlations. Note, however, that the vertical correlations of temperature do vary spatially.

This is because in the tropics they are determined by the correlations defined for the unbalanced temperature,

whereas in middle latitudes they are largely determined implicitly by the action of the balance operator on the vor-

ticity correlation matrix.

Fig. 1 (a) shows the vertical correlation of temperature error with model level 18 of the ECMWF 31-level model

(level 18 is at approximately 500hPa). The statistics were estimated using the NMC method (see below). Note that

the vertical extent of the correlation is smaller in the tropics than in middle latitudes. Figure 1b shows the vertical

correlations for temperature implied by the Jb formulation. Note that the main latitudinal variation in the vertical

correlations is retained.

The effect of the balance operator in accounting for correlation between geopotential height and wind is demon-

strated by Fig. 2 , which shows the wind increments generated by a single geopotential height observation at 60N,

30W. In Fig. 2 (a), the observation is placed at 1000hPa, and wind increments are shown for the nearest model level

to 1000hPa. Note that the wind increment includes a convergent component. This is generated by the inclusion in

the balance operator of a correlation between divergence and vorticity. Fig. 2 (b) shows the wind increment near

300hPa for a height observation at 300hPa. In this case, the increment is slightly divergent.

section of the increment generated by a single temperature observation at 200hPa.

3.3  Calculation of the background-error correlations

The previous section showed that, by making some simplifying assumptions, the number of non-zero elements of

the background error covariance matrix may be drastically reduced. The largest matrices are of of order the number

of levels of the model, and may be estimated statistically from a sample of background error of size a few times

the number of levels.

Unfortunately, we cannot calculate background error, since this would require knowledge of the true state of the

atmosphere. There are three main approaches to get round the problem:

3.3 (a)  The Hollingsworth and Lönnberg (1986) method. This method looks at the spatial covariance of dif-

ferences between observations and the background. These differences are a combination of background and obser-

vation error. We can partition the error into background errors and observation errors by assuming that the

observation errors are spatially uncorrelated. If we bin observation-minus-background as a function of distance

from each observation, only the zero-distance bin will contain a contribution from the observation error.

The Hollingsworth and Lönnberg (1986) method has the advantage that it is a direct diagnosis of background error

covariance. However, it requires a uniform set of unbiased observations with spatially uncorrelated error. This

makes it unsuitable for calculating the global statistics required by 3dVar. In addition, the method produces statis-

tics for observable quantities such as wind and temperature, whereas the background cost function requires statis-

tics for vorticity and unbalanced components of temperature, etc.. Nevertheless, the method remains a valuable

tool. In particular, it can be used to verify that the standard deviations of background and observation error are cor-

rectly specified.

3.3 (b)  The NMC method (Parrish and Derber, 1992). This method was used until recently in the ECMWF

3dVar and 4dVar systems. The method assumes that the statistical structure of forecast errors varies little over 48

hours. Under this assumption, the spatial correlations of backgound error should be similar to the correlations of

differences between 48h and 24h forecasts verifying at the same time.

The advantage of the method is that it is straightforward to calculate the required global statistics. The disadvantage

is that the underlying assumption that the statistical structure of 48h forecast error is similar to that of background

error is difficult to justify.

3.3 (c)  The analysis–ensemble method. The method currently used at ECMWF to estimate background error

statistics is to run an ensemble of independent analysis experiments. For each experiment, the observations are per-

turbed by adding random noise drawn from the assumed distribution of observation error. The effect of the pertur-

bations is to generate differences in the analyses for each experiment. These are propagated to the next analysis

cycle as differences in backgrounds. After a few days of assimilation, the statistics of differences between back-

ground fields for pairs of members of the ensemble equilibrate, and in principle become representative of the true

statistics of background error. As a further refinement to the method, the effect of model error may be represented

by introducing random perturbations to the physical parameterizations used in the assimilating model.

Figs. 4 and 5 show some statistics of background error calculated using the analysis-ensemble method (figure 4)

and the NMC method (Fig. 5 ). The analysis-ensemble method gives background correlations which are smaller in

horizontal and vertical scale than those produced by the NMC method. The background differences are also less

balanced than the forecast differences used by the NMC method.

3.4  Calculation of background-error variances

The variance of background error is specified in gridpoint space. This allows the spatial variability of background

error to be taken into account. (For example, background error variance is likely to be relatively smaller in areas of

dense observational coverage, than in areas where there are few observations.) In practice, only the vorticity and

specific humidity variances have a horizontal variation of background variance in the ECMWF 3dVar. (Note, how-

ever that the balance operator implies a horizontal variation of the balanced components of the other analysed var-

iables.)

For specific humidity, background error variances are given by an empirical formula which expresses the relative

humidity background error as a function of temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, background errors for

humidity are reduced to very small values in the stratosphere, and are reduced at low levels over sea.

For vorticity, three-dimensional fields of background error standard deviation are calculated using a cycling algo-

rithm (Fisher and Courtier, 1995) which applies an empirical error-growth model to a diagnostic estimation of the

standard deviations of analysis error.
